# Hebrew Words (Old Testament)

---

### Ahavah (אַהֲבָה)

**Original:** אַהֲבָה
**Transliteration:** ahavah (ah-hah-VAH)
**Definition:** Love, affection, devotion
**Expanded meaning:** The Hebrew word for love that encompasses both emotional affection and active choice. It appears in both the great commandment (Deuteronomy 6:5) and in romantic contexts (Song of Solomon). Unlike English which uses one word for all loves, ahavah specifically denotes covenant love—love that persists through action regardless of feeling.
**Key verses:** Deuteronomy 6:5, Leviticus 19:18, Hosea 11:1
**Theological significance:** Ahavah reveals that biblical love is never merely sentiment—it is covenant commitment expressed through action. When God commands us to love Him and our neighbor, He calls us to loyal action, not emotional manipulation. The same word describes God's love for Israel despite their unfaithfulness, demonstrating that true love perseveres.

---

### Bara (בָּרָא)

**Original:** בָּרָא
**Transliteration:** bara (bah-RAH)
**Definition:** To create from nothing
**Expanded meaning:** A verb used exclusively with God as the subject in the Hebrew Bible. Unlike "asah" (to make or fashion from existing material), bara implies creation ex nihilo—from nothing. It appears in Genesis 1:1 and whenever God does something radically new that no human could accomplish.
**Key verses:** Genesis 1:1, Isaiah 43:1, Psalm 51:10
**Theological significance:** Bara establishes God's unique creative authority. No human "bara's" anything—only God speaks into the void and brings forth existence. When David prays "Create in me a clean heart," he uses bara, acknowledging that only God can make something from the nothing of human corruption.

---

### Chesed (חֶסֶד)

**Original:** חֶסֶד
**Transliteration:** chesed (KHEH-sed)
**Definition:** Loyal love, lovingkindness, mercy
**Expanded meaning:** Perhaps the most theologically rich word in Hebrew, chesed appears over 240 times in the Old Testament. It combines loyalty, love, and mercy into one concept that has no single English equivalent. Chesed is covenant faithfulness expressed through gracious action—God's persistent, stubborn, refusal-to-give-up love.
**Key verses:** Psalm 136 (26 times), Exodus 34:6, Micah 6:8
**Theological significance:** Chesed is what makes God, God. In Exodus 34:6, when Moses asks to see God's glory, God reveals His character: "abounding in chesed." This word appears in every chapter of Psalm 136 as the refrain "His chesed endures forever." It's the love that pursues the unfaithful, forgives the guilty, and restores the broken.

---

### Davar (דָּבָר)

**Original:** דָּבָר
**Transliteration:** davar (dah-VAHR)
**Definition:** Word, thing, matter, event
**Expanded meaning:** In Hebrew thought, words and things are inseparable. Davar means both "word" and "thing"—revealing that in the Hebrew mind, when God speaks, things happen. Words create reality. This is why "the word of the Lord" carries such weight—it's not just information, it's creative power.
**Key verses:** Genesis 1:3, Psalm 33:6, Jeremiah 1:4
**Theological significance:** Davar bridges the gap between speech and reality. God's davar creates the universe, calls prophets, and becomes flesh in Jesus. Understanding davar helps us grasp why Scripture is called "the word of God"—not merely words about God, but God's active, reality-creating communication.

---

### Emet (אֱמֶת)

**Original:** אֱמֶת
**Transliteration:** emet (eh-MET)
**Definition:** Truth, faithfulness, reliability
**Expanded meaning:** Emet comes from the root "aman" (to support, confirm) and shares its origin with "amen." Biblical truth is not abstract philosophical accuracy but trustworthy faithfulness. When something is emet, you can lean your full weight on it. God is emet because He can be completely trusted.
**Key verses:** Exodus 34:6, Psalm 25:5, John 14:6 (aletheia)
**Theological significance:** Emet challenges our modern concept of truth as mere factual accuracy. In Scripture, truth is relational—it's about being trustworthy, reliable, and faithful. When Jesus says "I am the truth," He claims to be the one reality you can stake your life on.

---

### Gaal (גָּאַל)

**Original:** גָּאַל
**Transliteration:** gaal (gah-AHL)
**Definition:** To redeem, act as kinsman-redeemer
**Expanded meaning:** Gaal describes the action of a close relative who rescues a family member from debt, slavery, or danger. The goel (redeemer) had legal rights and responsibilities to buy back lost property, avenge wrongful death, and marry a childless widow. It's not generic rescue—it's family rescue.
**Key verses:** Ruth 4:4, Isaiah 44:22, Job 19:25
**Theological significance:** When Job declares "I know my Redeemer (goel) lives," he claims God as family. When Isaiah says God "redeems" Israel, he uses gaal—God acts as next-of-kin. This word reaches its climax in Jesus, who becomes our brother (Hebrews 2:11) so He can be our goel, buying us back from slavery to sin.

---

### Hevel (הֶבֶל)

**Original:** הֶבֶל
**Transliteration:** hevel (HEH-vel)
**Definition:** Vapor, breath, fleeting
**Expanded meaning:** Made famous by Ecclesiastes ("Vanity of vanities"), hevel literally means breath or vapor—something you can see momentarily but cannot grasp. It's not that life is meaningless; it's that life is brief, elusive, and ultimately ungraspable. Solomon uses it 38 times to describe human achievement.
**Key verses:** Ecclesiastes 1:2, Psalm 39:5, Psalm 144:4
**Theological significance:** Hevel is Ecclesiastes' master theme. Solomon isn't nihilistic—he's honest. All human striving produces results as permanent as your breath on a cold morning. The response isn't despair but reorientation: fear God, enjoy His gifts, and stop trying to make vapor into something solid.

---

### Kabod (כָּבוֹד)

**Original:** כָּבוֹד
**Transliteration:** kabod (kah-VOHD)
**Definition:** Glory, weight, honor
**Expanded meaning:** Kabod literally means "heaviness" or "weight." When applied to God, it describes His substantial reality, His gravitas, His "weight" in the universe. The glory of God is not merely bright light—it's the overwhelming presence of ultimate reality. Everything else is lightweight by comparison.
**Key verses:** Exodus 33:18, Psalm 19:1, Isaiah 6:3
**Theological significance:** Kabod helps us understand that God's glory isn't decorative—it's the density of His being. When Moses asks to see God's glory, he's asking to experience God's full weight. The heavens "declare" God's kabod because creation groans under the weight of its Creator's fingerprints.

---

### Lev (לֵב)

**Original:** לֵב
**Transliteration:** lev (LEV)
**Definition:** Heart, mind, will, inner self
**Expanded meaning:** Unlike English where "heart" typically refers to emotions, the Hebrew lev encompasses the entire inner person—mind, will, emotions, and desires. It's the command center of human existence, the place where decisions are made and character is formed. "Guard your heart" means guard everything that makes you, you.
**Key verses:** Proverbs 4:23, Deuteronomy 6:5, Jeremiah 17:9
**Theological significance:** Biblical anthropology centers on the lev. It's deceitfully wicked (Jeremiah 17:9) but also where God writes His law (Jeremiah 31:33). Heart transformation is the essence of salvation—not behavior modification but lev renovation. God doesn't want your outward compliance; He wants your lev.

---

### Menuchah (מְנוּחָה)

**Original:** מְנוּחָה
**Transliteration:** menuchah (meh-noo-KHAH)
**Definition:** Rest, place of rest, settled peace
**Expanded meaning:** More than mere cessation of work, menuchah describes arriving home, finding a settled place of belonging and peace. It's the rest of completion, not exhaustion. The Promised Land was Israel's menuchah—not just a location but a state of arrived rest.
**Key verses:** Psalm 23:2 ("still waters"), Ruth 1:9, Psalm 95:11
**Theological significance:** Menuchah is what humans search for but cannot manufacture. Israel sought it in the land but found it only partially. The author of Hebrews reveals that a menuchah remains for God's people (Hebrews 4:9)—ultimate rest found only in Christ, the true Promised Land.

---

### Nephesh (נֶפֶשׁ)

**Original:** נֶפֶשׁ
**Transliteration:** nephesh (NEH-fesh)
**Definition:** Soul, life, self, being
**Expanded meaning:** Often translated "soul," nephesh is broader—it's the whole living person, the animated self that breathes, desires, and relates. Humans don't merely have a nephesh; they are a nephesh (Genesis 2:7). It encompasses physical and spiritual existence as an integrated whole.
**Key verses:** Genesis 2:7, Psalm 42:1, Matthew 16:26
**Theological significance:** Nephesh corrects Greek-influenced body/soul dualism. Humans aren't souls trapped in bodies but embodied souls—whole persons. "My nephesh longs for You" isn't just spiritual longing; it's total-person yearning. Salvation rescues the whole nephesh, not just an immaterial part.

---

### Olam (עוֹלָם)

**Original:** עוֹלָם
**Transliteration:** olam (oh-LAHM)
**Definition:** Eternity, forever, ancient time
**Expanded meaning:** Olam stretches time in both directions—into the distant past and endless future. When God is called "El Olam" (Everlasting God), it means He exists beyond the boundaries of time itself. Olam is not just long duration but timelessness—existence without the constraints of beginning or end.
**Key verses:** Genesis 21:33, Ecclesiastes 3:11, Psalm 90:2
**Theological significance:** Ecclesiastes 3:11 says God has "set olam in the human heart"—eternity-awareness is hardwired into us. We know we're made for more than this vapor-brief life. This longing for olam is homesickness for Eden and anticipation of the age to come.

---

### Racham (רַחַם)

**Original:** רַחַם
**Transliteration:** racham (rah-KHAM)
**Definition:** Compassion, womb-love, deep mercy
**Expanded meaning:** Racham comes from the word for "womb" (rechem). It's the visceral, gut-level compassion a mother feels for the child of her womb. When God shows racham, it's not detached pity but deep, maternal-like emotion that moves to action.
**Key verses:** Exodus 33:19, Psalm 103:13, Isaiah 49:15
**Theological significance:** Racham reveals God's emotional involvement with His people. He doesn't observe human suffering with cold detachment—His "womb" moves with compassion. Even if a mother could forget her nursing child (impossible!), God says His racham will never fail (Isaiah 49:15).

---

### Ruach (רוּחַ)

**Original:** רוּחַ
**Transliteration:** ruach (ROO-akh)
**Definition:** Spirit, wind, breath
**Expanded meaning:** The same Hebrew word means wind, breath, and spirit—revealing their conceptual connection. God's ruach hovered over creation, breathed life into Adam, and empowers prophets. It's invisible yet powerfully evident in its effects, like wind moving through trees.
**Key verses:** Genesis 1:2, Genesis 2:7, Ezekiel 37:9
**Theological significance:** Ruach's triple meaning (wind/breath/spirit) shows the Hebrew view of spirit as dynamic life-force. The Spirit isn't ethereal but active—moving, breathing, animating. When Jesus breathes on the disciples and says "Receive the Holy Spirit" (John 20:22), He echoes God breathing life into Adam.

---

### Sabbat (שַׁבָּת)

**Original:** שַׁבָּת
**Transliteration:** shabbat (shah-BAHT)
**Definition:** Sabbath, rest, cessation
**Expanded meaning:** From the verb "to cease," shabbat is not merely inactivity but intentional stopping. It's trust expressed through rest—the radical declaration that the world will continue without my striving. God didn't rest because He was tired; He rested because creation was complete.
**Key verses:** Genesis 2:2-3, Exodus 20:8-11, Mark 2:27
**Theological significance:** Shabbat is theological protest against the tyranny of productivity. By stopping, Israel declared they were not slaves (unlike Egypt) and God was sovereign (unlike Pharaoh). Jesus fulfilled shabbat by offering Himself as true rest: "Come to me, all who are weary" (Matthew 11:28).

---

### Shalom (שָׁלוֹם)

**Original:** שָׁלוֹם
**Transliteration:** shalom (shah-LOHM)
**Definition:** Peace, completeness, wholeness, welfare
**Expanded meaning:** Far more than absence of conflict, shalom is comprehensive well-being—right relationship with God, self, others, and creation. It's things being as they should be. The root means "complete" or "whole." Shalom is God's design for human flourishing.
**Key verses:** Numbers 6:26, Isaiah 9:6, John 14:27
**Theological significance:** Shalom is the goal of salvation—complete restoration of all relationships broken by sin. Jesus is the "Prince of Shalom" (Isaiah 9:6) who brings peace with God (Romans 5:1) and will one day restore shalom to all creation. Greeting someone with "shalom" is a prayer for their total flourishing.

---

### Shema (שְׁמַע)

**Original:** שְׁמַע
**Transliteration:** shema (sheh-MAH)
**Definition:** Hear, listen, obey
**Expanded meaning:** Shema means more than auditory perception—it includes understanding and response. "Hear, O Israel" is a call not just to listen but to act. In Hebrew thought, you haven't truly heard until you've obeyed. Hearing and doing are inseparable.
**Key verses:** Deuteronomy 6:4, Isaiah 1:10, James 1:22
**Theological significance:** The Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4) is Judaism's central confession: "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." The command to "hear" assumes response. James echoes this: "Be doers of the word, not hearers only." True hearing transforms.

---

### Shuv (שׁוּב)

**Original:** שׁוּב
**Transliteration:** shuv (SHOOV)
**Definition:** Return, turn back, repent
**Expanded meaning:** The most common Hebrew word for repentance, shuv literally means to turn around and go back. It's not primarily emotional regret but directional change—you were heading one way, now you turn back toward God. The prophets repeatedly call Israel to shuv.
**Key verses:** Isaiah 55:7, Hosea 14:1, Joel 2:12
**Theological significance:** Shuv reveals repentance as homecoming. The prodigal son's "return" captures it perfectly—coming to your senses and going back to the Father. God's repeated call through the prophets is simply "Shuv!"—turn around, come home, I'm waiting.

---

### Teshuvah (תְּשׁוּבָה)

**Original:** תְּשׁוּבָה
**Transliteration:** teshuvah (teh-shoo-VAH)
**Definition:** Repentance, return, answer
**Expanded meaning:** The noun form of shuv, teshuvah became the technical term for repentance in Jewish theology. It carries connotations of both returning (to God) and answering (God's call). Teshuvah is responsive—it answers God's initiative with human turning.
**Key verses:** Ezekiel 18:32, Hosea 14:2, 1 Kings 8:35
**Theological significance:** Teshuvah is central to the High Holy Days in Judaism, the season of return. It encompasses confession, turning from sin, and returning to God. Christianity inherited this concept: repentance is not merely feeling sorry but actually changing direction.

---

### Tohu va-Vohu (תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ)

**Original:** תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ
**Transliteration:** tohu va-vohu (TOH-hoo vah-VOH-hoo)
**Definition:** Formless and void, chaos
**Expanded meaning:** This phrase describes the pre-creation state in Genesis 1:2—a wasteland of disorder before God's ordering word. It appears only three times in Scripture, always describing desolation. Creation is God imposing order on chaos; un-creation is chaos returning.
**Key verses:** Genesis 1:2, Isaiah 34:11, Jeremiah 4:23
**Theological significance:** Tohu va-vohu reveals that creation is not neutral—without God's sustaining word, things tend toward chaos. When Jeremiah sees judgment coming, he describes it as tohu va-vohu—un-creation, reversal of Genesis 1. Only God's word holds back the void.

---

### Torah (תּוֹרָה)

**Original:** תּוֹרָה
**Transliteration:** torah (toh-RAH)
**Definition:** Instruction, teaching, law
**Expanded meaning:** Often narrowly translated "law," torah comes from a root meaning "to throw" or "aim"—it's guidance for hitting the target of righteous living. Torah is less legal code and more life instruction, the loving guidance of a parent teaching a child how to live well.
**Key verses:** Psalm 1:2, Psalm 119:97, Romans 7:12
**Theological significance:** Understanding torah as "instruction" rather than merely "law" transforms how we read the Old Testament. God's commands aren't arbitrary rules but wisdom for flourishing. The Psalmist "delights" in torah because it's the path to life, not a burden to bear.

---

### Tsaddiq (צַדִּיק)

**Original:** צַדִּיק
**Transliteration:** tsaddiq (tsah-DEEK)
**Definition:** Righteous, just, innocent
**Expanded meaning:** A tsaddiq is one who is right with God and acts rightly toward others—vertical and horizontal righteousness combined. In Hebrew thought, righteousness is relational and active, not merely avoiding wrong but doing right, advocating for the vulnerable.
**Key verses:** Genesis 18:23, Psalm 1:6, Habakkuk 2:4
**Theological significance:** The great question of Scripture is how sinners become tsaddiq. Habakkuk 2:4 ("the righteous shall live by faith") becomes Paul's gospel banner (Romans 1:17). We are declared tsaddiq not by works but by faith in the Righteous One who became sin for us.

---

### Yada (יָדַע)

**Original:** יָדַע
**Transliteration:** yada (yah-DAH)
**Definition:** To know, to experience, to be intimate with
**Expanded meaning:** Hebrew knowledge is not abstract information but relational experience. Yada implies intimacy—"Adam knew Eve" (Genesis 4:1). To know God is not theological data but personal encounter. God "knows" His people (Amos 3:2) in covenantal intimacy.
**Key verses:** Genesis 4:1, Jeremiah 1:5, John 17:3
**Theological significance:** Yada redefines knowing God. It's not head knowledge but heart relationship. Eternal life is defined by Jesus as knowing the Father (John 17:3)—using the Greek equivalent (ginosko) with the same relational depth. God invites us to yada Him.

---

### Yeshua (יֵשׁוּעַ)

**Original:** יֵשׁוּעַ
**Transliteration:** yeshua (yeh-SHOO-ah)
**Definition:** Salvation, deliverance, rescue
**Expanded meaning:** Yeshua is the Hebrew name of Jesus, meaning "Yahweh saves" or "Yahweh is salvation." It's derived from the verb "yasha" (to save, rescue, deliver). Every time ancient Israelites spoke of God's salvation, they were unwittingly speaking the name of the coming Messiah.
**Key verses:** Matthew 1:21, Psalm 3:8, Isaiah 12:2
**Theological significance:** That Jesus was named Yeshua (Matthew 1:21) is theologically loaded: "You shall call His name 'Yahweh-Saves' because He will save His people from their sins." His name is His mission. Every cry for "yeshua!" in the Psalms anticipates Yeshua the person.

---

### Yirah (יִרְאָה)

**Original:** יִרְאָה
**Transliteration:** yirah (yir-AH)
**Definition:** Fear, awe, reverence
**Expanded meaning:** Yirah encompasses both terror and wonder—the spectrum of responses to encountering the Holy. "Fear of the LORD" is not cowering dread but awed respect, recognizing God's overwhelming otherness while being drawn into His presence. It's the beginning of wisdom.
**Key verses:** Proverbs 1:7, Psalm 111:10, Ecclesiastes 12:13
**Theological significance:** Yirah is wisdom's foundation (Proverbs 1:7). Without proper awe of God, all other knowledge is distorted. The angels cover their faces crying "Holy!" (Isaiah 6)—that's yirah. It's not fear that drives away but fear that draws in while keeping you appropriately low.

---

### Zikkaron (זִכָּרוֹן)

**Original:** זִכָּרוֹן
**Transliteration:** zikkaron (zik-kah-ROHN)
**Definition:** Memorial, remembrance, reminder
**Expanded meaning:** Zikkaron is active memory that shapes present identity and action. Biblical remembrance isn't nostalgic recollection but liturgical re-entering of past events. When Israel "remembers" Exodus, they become participants in it. Memory creates community across time.
**Key verses:** Exodus 12:14, Exodus 13:9, Joshua 4:7
**Theological significance:** "Do this in remembrance of me" (zikkaron) invites us into more than mental recall—we participate in Christ's death and resurrection through Communion. Memory in Scripture is never passive; it shapes identity and calls forth response.

---

# Greek Words (New Testament)

---

### Agape (ἀγάπη)

**Original:** ἀγάπη
**Transliteration:** agape (ah-GAH-pay)
**Definition:** Self-giving love, divine love
**Expanded meaning:** Agape was an uncommon word that the New Testament elevated to describe God's self-giving love. Unlike eros (romantic desire) or philia (friendship affection), agape loves regardless of the object's worthiness. It's love as decision and action, not emotion and attraction.
**Key verses:** John 3:16, 1 Corinthians 13, 1 John 4:8
**Theological significance:** "God is agape" (1 John 4:8) defines divine nature. This love sent the Son, endures all things, and never fails. The command to agape enemies (Matthew 5:44) proves it's not feeling but choice—we can't feel affection for enemies, but we can choose their good.

---

### Aletheia (ἀλήθεια)

**Original:** ἀλήθεια
**Transliteration:** aletheia (ah-LAY-thay-ah)
**Definition:** Truth, reality, genuineness
**Expanded meaning:** Literally meaning "un-hidden" or "unconcealed," aletheia is reality as it truly is, without distortion or pretense. When Jesus says "I am the truth," He claims to be reality unveiled, the revelation of how things actually are. Truth sets free (John 8:32) because reality liberates from illusion.
**Key verses:** John 14:6, John 8:32, John 17:17
**Theological significance:** In a world of competing narratives, Jesus claims not to merely teach truth but to be truth—the personal embodiment of reality. His word is aletheia (John 17:17). Sanctification happens as we conform to reality rather than living in self-constructed illusion.

---

### Apostolos (ἀπόστολος)

**Original:** ἀπόστολος
**Transliteration:** apostolos (ah-POS-toh-los)
**Definition:** Sent one, messenger, apostle
**Expanded meaning:** From "apo" (from) and "stello" (to send), an apostolos is one sent with authority on behalf of another. In Greco-Roman context, it described official envoys who spoke with the sender's authority. Jesus sent the Twelve as His authoritative representatives.
**Key verses:** Matthew 10:2, Acts 1:26, Hebrews 3:1
**Theological significance:** Jesus Himself is called apostolos (Hebrews 3:1)—sent from the Father. The Twelve become apostles not by self-appointment but by being sent. Their authority derives entirely from the One who sends. We too are sent (John 20:21).

---

### Baptizo (βαπτίζω)

**Original:** βαπτίζω
**Transliteration:** baptizo (bap-TID-zo)
**Definition:** To immerse, dip, submerge
**Expanded meaning:** In non-religious Greek, baptizo meant to plunge, dip, or submerge—used for sinking ships or dyeing cloth. When cloth was baptizo'd in dye, it was transformed by immersion, taking on new identity. Christian baptism signifies death-burial-resurrection with Christ.
**Key verses:** Matthew 3:11, Romans 6:3-4, Colossians 2:12
**Theological significance:** Baptism's meaning is in its method: we go under (death with Christ), we come up (resurrection with Christ). It's not mere ritual washing but enacted death—we are "buried with Him through baptizo" (Romans 6:4). The old self drowns; a new creation emerges.

---

### Basileia (βασιλεία)

**Original:** βασιλεία
**Transliteration:** basileia (bah-sih-LAY-ah)
**Definition:** Kingdom, reign, rule
**Expanded meaning:** Basileia emphasizes not territory but reign—the active exercise of royal authority. "Kingdom of God" means not a place where God reigns but the reality of God reigning. It's both present ("among you") and future ("your kingdom come"), already inaugurated but not yet consummated.
**Key verses:** Matthew 6:33, Mark 1:15, Luke 17:21
**Theological significance:** Jesus' central message was the basileia—God's reign breaking into the world. It subverts earthly power structures ("not of this world") while being utterly real. Seeking the basileia first (Matthew 6:33) means aligning with God's reign as ultimate priority.

---

### Charisma (χάρισμα)

**Original:** χάρισμα
**Transliteration:** charisma (KAH-ris-mah)
**Definition:** Gift of grace, spiritual gift
**Expanded meaning:** From charis (grace), a charisma is a grace-gift—something freely given by God for service to others. The charismata are not natural talents but Spirit-empowered abilities given for building up the body. Every believer has at least one (1 Peter 4:10).
**Key verses:** Romans 12:6, 1 Corinthians 12:4, 1 Peter 4:10
**Theological significance:** Charisma redefines giftedness. Spiritual gifts aren't for personal advantage but community edification. They're manifestations of grace, not merit badges. The variety of gifts reflects the diversity of the Trinity; the unity of purpose reflects the one Spirit.

---

### Charis (χάρις)

**Original:** χάρις
**Transliteration:** charis (KHAH-ris)
**Definition:** Grace, favor, gift
**Expanded meaning:** In secular Greek, charis was the favor shown by a superior to an inferior, or the gratitude of the recipient. Christian usage deepens this: charis is God's unmerited favor toward sinners, His disposition to bless those who deserve curse. Grace is not merely undeserved—it's ill-deserved.
**Key verses:** Ephesians 2:8-9, John 1:14, 2 Corinthians 12:9
**Theological significance:** Charis is Christianity's distinctive contribution to religious vocabulary. Salvation is by charis through faith—pure gift, received not earned. This eliminates boasting while establishing radical gratitude. Grace doesn't lower God's standards; it meets them on our behalf.

---

### Dikaiosyne (δικαιοσύνη)

**Original:** δικαιοσύνη
**Transliteration:** dikaiosyne (dih-kai-oh-SOO-nay)
**Definition:** Righteousness, justice, right standing
**Expanded meaning:** Dikaiosyne encompasses both right standing before God (being declared righteous) and right living before others (acting justly). It's forensic (legal status) and ethical (moral behavior). Paul's gospel centers on how God declares sinners dikaios (righteous) through faith.
**Key verses:** Romans 1:17, Matthew 6:33, 2 Corinthians 5:21
**Theological significance:** The gospel reveals "the dikaiosyne of God" (Romans 1:17)—not God's standard that condemns us but God's gift that saves us. Christ becomes our dikaiosyne (1 Corinthians 1:30). Justified people then pursue justice because they've received it.

---

### Doulos (δοῦλος)

**Original:** δοῦλος
**Transliteration:** doulos (DOO-los)
**Definition:** Slave, servant, bondservant
**Expanded meaning:** A doulos was someone owned by another, with no independent rights. Paul, Peter, and James all identify themselves as "douloi of Christ"—not hired servants but owned slaves. This radical self-description claims Jesus as absolute Lord while finding freedom in His service.
**Key verses:** Romans 1:1, Philippians 2:7, Galatians 1:10
**Theological significance:** Calling oneself Christ's doulos is simultaneously humble and exalted—humble because it claims no independent status, exalted because it serves the King of kings. Jesus Himself took "the form of a doulos" (Philippians 2:7), dignifying slavery by entering it.

---

### Eirene (εἰρήνη)

**Original:** εἰρήνη
**Transliteration:** eirene (ay-RAY-nay)
**Definition:** Peace, harmony, wholeness
**Expanded meaning:** The Greek equivalent of shalom, eirene in the New Testament carries the Hebrew concept of comprehensive well-being into Greek language. It's not just absence of conflict but presence of right relationships. The "peace of God" guards hearts and minds (Philippians 4:7).
**Key verses:** John 14:27, Romans 5:1, Philippians 4:7
**Theological significance:** Jesus bequeaths His eirene to disciples (John 14:27)—not as the world gives. Through Christ, we have eirene with God (Romans 5:1)—the cosmic conflict resolved. This vertical peace flows into horizontal reconciliation and internal stability.

---

### Ekklesia (ἐκκλησία)

**Original:** ἐκκλησία
**Transliteration:** ekklesia (ek-klay-SEE-ah)
**Definition:** Assembly, church, called-out ones
**Expanded meaning:** From "ek" (out) and "kaleo" (call), ekklesia was the Greek term for a civic assembly of citizens called together for public business. The New Testament adopts this word for those called out from the world into God's new community—local gatherings and the universal body of Christ.
**Key verses:** Matthew 16:18, Acts 2:42, Ephesians 5:25
**Theological significance:** Jesus builds His ekklesia (Matthew 16:18)—not merely an institution but a people called from darkness into light. The ekklesia is Christ's body, His bride, His building project. It exists wherever two or three gather in His name.

---

### Eleutheria (ἐλευθερία)

**Original:** ἐλευθερία
**Transliteration:** eleutheria (eh-loo-theh-REE-ah)
**Definition:** Freedom, liberty
**Expanded meaning:** In Greek thought, eleutheria was self-determination and political freedom. Paul radically redefines it: true freedom is freedom from sin, law-keeping as salvation strategy, and death. It's freedom for love and service, not autonomy from God.
**Key verses:** Galatians 5:1, John 8:36, 2 Corinthians 3:17
**Theological significance:** "For eleutheria Christ has set us free" (Galatians 5:1). But this freedom isn't license—it's liberation for love. We're freed from sin to serve righteousness, freed from self to serve others. Where the Spirit is, there is eleutheria.

### Euangelion (εὐαγγέλιον)

**Original:** εὐαγγέλιον
**Transliteration:** euangelion (you-an-GEL-ee-on)
**Definition:** Good news, gospel
**Expanded meaning:** In the Roman world, euangelion was the announcement of military victory or a new emperor's ascension—news that changed everything for everyone. The Christian euangelion announces Jesus' victory over sin and death and His reign as true Lord. It's not advice; it's news.
**Key verses:** Mark 1:1, Romans 1:16, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4
**Theological significance:** The euangelion is not instruction on how to save yourself but announcement that you have been saved. It's historical news (Christ died, was buried, rose) with cosmic implications. Paul calls it "the power of God for salvation" (Romans 1:16).

---

### Ginosko (γινώσκω)

**Original:** γινώσκω
**Transliteration:** ginosko (gih-NOHS-ko)
**Definition:** To know, perceive, understand
**Expanded meaning:** Like Hebrew yada, ginosko is relational knowledge—not mere information but personal acquaintance. To ginosko God is to be in relationship with Him. Eternal life is defined as knowing (ginosko) the Father and Son (John 17:3).
**Key verses:** John 17:3, Philippians 3:10, 1 John 2:3
**Theological significance:** Paul's life goal was to ginosko Christ (Philippians 3:10)—not accumulate facts about Him but experience Him personally. This knowledge is progressive, relational, and transformative. We know Him, and we are known by Him.

---

### Hamartia (ἁμαρτία)

**Original:** ἁμαρτία
**Transliteration:** hamartia (hah-mar-TEE-ah)
**Definition:** Sin, missing the mark, failure
**Expanded meaning:** Originally an archery term for missing the target, hamartia became the primary New Testament word for sin. It's not just rule-breaking but missing God's design for human flourishing. Sin is falling short of glory (Romans 3:23)—missing the target of God's intention.
**Key verses:** Romans 3:23, Romans 6:23, 1 John 1:9
**Theological significance:** Hamartia reveals sin's nature: not primarily what we do but who we are. We don't become sinners by sinning; we sin because we're sinners. We need more than behavior modification—we need new birth. Christ became hamartia for us (2 Corinthians 5:21).

---

### Hilasterion (ἱλαστήριον)

**Original:** ἱλαστήριον
**Transliteration:** hilasterion (hih-las-TAY-ree-on)
**Definition:** Propitiation, mercy seat, place of atonement
**Expanded meaning:** The Greek term for the ark of the covenant's cover where blood was sprinkled on Yom Kippur. When Paul says God presented Christ as hilasterion (Romans 3:25), he declares Jesus the place where God's wrath and mercy meet—where sin is covered and relationship restored.
**Key verses:** Romans 3:25, 1 John 2:2, Hebrews 9:5
**Theological significance:** Hilasterion answers the question: How can a holy God forgive sin? Through the blood-sprinkled mercy seat, now embodied in Christ. He satisfies divine justice (propitiation) while covering human sin (expiation). The cross is the true hilasterion.

---

### Kairos (καιρός)

**Original:** καιρός
**Transliteration:** kairos (kai-ROS)
**Definition:** Appointed time, opportune moment, season
**Expanded meaning:** Unlike chronos (measured time), kairos is qualitative time—the right moment, the critical juncture. Jesus announces the kairos has arrived (Mark 1:15). It's time pregnant with significance, demanding response. You can't manage kairos; you can only recognize and respond.
**Key verses:** Mark 1:15, Ephesians 5:16, Galatians 4:4
**Theological significance:** God works in kairos moments—Christ came at "the fullness of time" (Galatians 4:4). We are called to "redeem the kairos" (Ephesians 5:16), recognizing divine appointments in ordinary days. Not all moments are equal; some carry eternal weight.

---

### Koinonia (κοινωνία)

**Original:** κοινωνία
**Transliteration:** koinonia (koy-no-NEE-ah)
**Definition:** Fellowship, communion, participation
**Expanded meaning:** From koinos (common), koinonia is shared participation in something held together. It's deeper than socializing—it's mutual indwelling in a common life. The early church "devoted themselves to koinonia" (Acts 2:42), sharing possessions, meals, and prayer.
**Key verses:** Acts 2:42, 1 Corinthians 10:16, 1 John 1:3
**Theological significance:** Koinonia is Trinitarian: we are invited into the fellowship that the Father, Son, and Spirit have shared eternally. Our koinonia with each other flows from koinonia with God. It's not optional for believers—it's the nature of the new community.

---

### Logos (λόγος)

**Original:** λόγος
**Transliteration:** logos (LOH-gos)
**Definition:** Word, reason, message
**Expanded meaning:** In Greek philosophy, logos was cosmic reason—the principle ordering the universe. John brilliantly applies this to Jesus: the Logos was with God, was God, and became flesh (John 1:1-14). Christ is both God's self-expression and the universe's ordering principle.
**Key verses:** John 1:1, John 1:14, Hebrews 4:12
**Theological significance:** "The Logos became flesh" is Christianity's central claim. Not just that Jesus taught God's word but that He is God's Word—God's full self-disclosure in human form. All that can be known of God is revealed in the Logos made visible.

---

### Lytron (λύτρον)

**Original:** λύτρον
**Transliteration:** lytron (LOO-tron)
**Definition:** Ransom, price of release
**Expanded meaning:** In the ancient world, lytron was the price paid to free a slave or prisoner. Jesus declared He came to give His life as lytron for many (Mark 10:45). We were slaves; He paid our release price. The cost was His blood.
**Key verses:** Mark 10:45, 1 Timothy 2:6, 1 Peter 1:18-19
**Theological significance:** Lytron answers: What did the cross accomplish? It paid our ransom from sin, death, and the devil's domain. We were bought with a price (1 Corinthians 6:20)—not silver or gold but precious blood. Redemption isn't metaphor; it's purchase.

---

### Metanoia (μετάνοια)

**Original:** μετάνοια
**Transliteration:** metanoia (meh-tah-NOY-ah)
**Definition:** Repentance, change of mind, conversion
**Expanded meaning:** From "meta" (change) and "nous" (mind), metanoia is fundamental reorientation of thinking that leads to changed behavior. It's not just regret but radical mental revolution—seeing God, self, and world differently. Both John the Baptist and Jesus began preaching with "Metanoia!"
**Key verses:** Matthew 3:2, Acts 2:38, 2 Corinthians 7:10
**Theological significance:** Metanoia is the human response the gospel demands. It's not earning salvation but receiving it—the mind turns from self-trust to Christ-trust. Without metanoia, hearing the gospel is worthless. It's intellectual, emotional, and volitional transformation.

---

### Mysterion (μυστήριον)

**Original:** μυστήριον
**Transliteration:** mysterion (moos-TAY-ree-on)
**Definition:** Mystery, secret, hidden truth now revealed
**Expanded meaning:** Not something unknowable but something previously hidden now disclosed. Paul uses mysterion for the gospel secret: Gentiles included in God's people, Christ in us, God's eternal plan unveiled. A mysterion is revealed, not figured out.
**Key verses:** Romans 16:25, Ephesians 3:3-6, Colossians 1:27
**Theological significance:** The great mysterion is "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27). The mystery hidden for ages is now revealed: God was in Christ reconciling the world, and believing Gentiles share in Abraham's promises. Revelation trumps speculation.

---

### Parakletos (παράκλητος)

**Original:** παράκλητος
**Transliteration:** parakletos (pah-RAH-klay-tos)
**Definition:** Helper, advocate, comforter
**Expanded meaning:** From "para" (alongside) and "kaleo" (call), a parakletos is one called to stand beside you—in court as advocate, in distress as comforter, in confusion as counselor. Jesus calls the Holy Spirit "another Parakletos" (John 14:16), implying He Himself was the first.
**Key verses:** John 14:16, John 14:26, 1 John 2:1
**Theological significance:** We have two Parakletoi: the Spirit within and Christ interceding above (1 John 2:1). We're never alone, never without advocate. The Spirit doesn't replace Jesus; He makes Jesus present—teaching, reminding, testifying, convicting.

---

### Pistis (πίστις)

**Original:** πίστις
**Transliteration:** pistis (PIS-tis)
**Definition:** Faith, trust, belief, faithfulness
**Expanded meaning:** Pistis covers both believing (human faith in God) and being faithful (God's faithfulness to us). It's not mere intellectual assent but active trust—entrusting yourself to someone reliable. Abraham's pistis was counted as righteousness (Romans 4:3) because it trusted God's promise.
**Key verses:** Romans 1:17, Hebrews 11:1, Galatians 2:20
**Theological significance:** Salvation is "by grace through pistis" (Ephesians 2:8). Faith is the empty hand that receives grace's gift. But pistis is also faithfulness—Christ's "faithfulness" may be the meaning of "faith of Christ" (Galatians 2:20). We trust in the Faithful One.

---

### Pleroma (πλήρωμα)

**Original:** πλήρωμα
**Transliteration:** pleroma (PLAY-ro-mah)
**Definition:** Fullness, completion, totality
**Expanded meaning:** Pleroma is the state of being complete, lacking nothing. In Christ dwells "all the pleroma of deity bodily" (Colossians 2:9)—not part of God but the full package. Believers are "filled to all the pleroma of God" (Ephesians 3:19)—God holding nothing back.
**Key verses:** Colossians 1:19, Colossians 2:9, Ephesians 3:19
**Theological significance:** Christ's pleroma refutes any diminished Christology: He is not 80% divine but fully God in human form. Our pleroma in Him refutes any diminished gospel: we lack no spiritual blessing in Christ. The fullness we seek is already ours.

---

### Pneuma (πνεῦμα)

**Original:** πνεῦμα
**Transliteration:** pneuma (PNYOO-mah)
**Definition:** Spirit, wind, breath
**Expanded meaning:** Like Hebrew ruach, pneuma means wind, breath, and spirit. The Holy Pneuma is God's active presence—invisible yet powerful like wind. Humans have pneuma (spirit) distinct from psyche (soul) and soma (body), though all three constitute the whole person.
**Key verses:** John 3:8, Romans 8:16, 1 Corinthians 2:10
**Theological significance:** Jesus compares Spirit-birth to wind: "you cannot tell where it comes from or where it goes" (John 3:8). The Pneuma is free, sovereign, mysterious. Yet He indwells believers, bearing witness with our pneuma that we are God's children (Romans 8:16).

---

### Sarx (σάρξ)

**Original:** σάρξ
**Transliteration:** sarx (SARKS)
**Definition:** Flesh, human nature, sinful nature
**Expanded meaning:** Sarx has multiple uses: literal flesh/body, humanity in general, or (distinctively Pauline) the sinful nature in rebellion against God. "The works of the sarx" (Galatians 5:19-21) are sin patterns. The battle is pneuma versus sarx—Spirit versus flesh.
**Key verses:** John 1:14, Romans 8:5-8, Galatians 5:16-17
**Theological significance:** "The Logos became sarx" (John 1:14) is the incarnation—God taking human nature. But sarx can also mean corrupt human nature hostile to God (Romans 8:7). Walking "according to the pneuma" is victory over sarx's gravitational pull.

---

### Soter (σωτήρ)

**Original:** σωτήρ
**Transliteration:** soter (so-TARE)
**Definition:** Savior, deliverer, rescuer
**Expanded meaning:** In the Greco-Roman world, soter was a title for gods, emperors, and benefactors who rescued their people. The New Testament claims this title exclusively for God the Father and Jesus Christ—they alone can save from sin, death, and judgment.
**Key verses:** Luke 2:11, Titus 2:13, 2 Peter 1:1
**Theological significance:** Calling Jesus "Soter" was politically subversive: Caesar claimed the title, but Jesus is "Savior of the world" (John 4:42). Only He saves—not merely from circumstances but from sin itself. "Call His name Jesus, for He will soter His people from their sins" (Matthew 1:21).

---

### Soteria (σωτηρία)

**Original:** σωτηρία
**Transliteration:** soteria (so-tay-REE-ah)
**Definition:** Salvation, deliverance, preservation
**Expanded meaning:** Soteria is comprehensive rescue: past (justified), present (sanctified), future (glorified). It's deliverance from sin's penalty, power, and presence. The gospel is "the power of God for soteria" (Romans 1:16)—not just fire insurance but whole-life transformation.
**Key verses:** Romans 1:16, Ephesians 2:8, Philippians 2:12
**Theological significance:** Soteria is past, present, and future tense in Scripture. We have been saved (Ephesians 2:8), we are being saved (1 Corinthians 1:18), we will be saved (Romans 5:9). Salvation is complete in Christ yet being worked out in us.

---

### Zoe (ζωή)

**Original:** ζωή
**Transliteration:** zoe (zo-AY)
**Definition:** Life, eternal life, vitality
**Expanded meaning:** While bios is biological life, zoe is life in its fullest sense—divine life, eternal life, abundant life. Jesus came that we might have zoe "abundantly" (John 10:10). Eternal zoe is not just endless duration but qualitatively different life—knowing God.
**Key verses:** John 1:4, John 10:10, John 17:3
**Theological significance:** "In Him was zoe" (John 1:4)—Christ is the source of all life. Eternal zoe is defined relationally: "knowing You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ" (John 17:3). It begins now, not at death. Zoe is relationship with the Living One.
