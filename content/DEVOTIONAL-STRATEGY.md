# Devotional Content Strategy

**Version:** 2.0
**Last Updated:** January 16, 2026
**Status:** DRAFT - Refined Through Conversation

---

## Core Decisions

### 1. Primary Format: Deep Dive Narrative Essays

Each devotional is a **cohesive 4,000± word essay**, not fragmented modules. The reading experience should feel like getting lost in a good book.

### 2. Structure: PaRDeS + Chiasm

Every devotional follows:

- **PaRDeS**: Four levels of interpretation (Plain, Hint, Search, Secret)
- **Chiasm**: Mirroring structure (A-B-C-B'-A')

### 3. Meta-Story Thread

Every devotional explicitly connects to **God's big story of reconciliation**. The Bible is ONE narrative, not random stories.

### 4. Interactive Elements

Experience, not just reading. Breath prayers, journaling, physical practices, art responses, Scripture memory, music suggestions.

### 5. Consistency with Variation

- **Structure is consistent** (prevents disorientation)
- **Content varies** (different Scriptures, Hebrew words, stories, interactive elements)
- **Format rotation is reserved** for audience-specific series, not the core

### 6. Cost Model: High-Quality Static

- One-time generation/writing cost
- $0 per-user serving
- Soul Audit matches users to the right content (low cost)

---

## Content Architecture

### CORE: Through the Bible (365 Days)

**Purpose:** Cover the span of Scripture in one year with narrative cohesion.

**Distribution:**

### 1. Timeline Placement

> "Today we're in [CREATION / FALL / PROMISE / EXODUS / KINGDOM / EXILE / INCARNATION / PASSION / RESURRECTION / CHURCH / CONSUMMATION]"

### 2. Backward Link

> "This connects to [previous event/passage] because..."

### 3. Forward Link

### 4. The Big Question

> "How does this moment reveal God's relentless pursuit of reconciliation with humanity?"

## Production Approach

### Phase 1: Core Content Creation

**365 Through-the-Bible Devotionals**

- One-time generation/writing
- Estimated cost if AI-generated: ~$60-90
- Requires founder review for theological accuracy
- Quality check on PaRDeS depth, chiasm structure, meta-story connection

### Phase 2: Audience-Specific Series

**8-10 Branch Series**

- Written with specific audience lens
- Format adapted to audience needs
- ~200 additional devotionals

### Phase 3: Meta-Story Series

**52 Weekly Deep-Dives**

- Teaches users to read the Bible as one story
- More scholarly/teaching tone
- Longer format (~5,000-6,000 words)

---

## Quality Benchmarks

Every devotional should:

1. **Feel cohesive** — One voice, one narrative, not pasted pieces
2. **Teach something new** — Hebrew etymology, historical context, or theological insight
3. **Tell a compelling story** — Modern narrative that illuminates
4. **Connect to Christ** — Explicit Christological link
5. **Invite response** — Reflection + interactive element
6. **Place in the meta-story** — Where are we in God's story?
7. **Respect the reader** — Intelligent, not dumbed down; honest, not manipulative

---

## What's Still Needed

1. **Sample devotional** — Generate/write one complete devotional as proof-of-concept
2. **Segment taxonomy** — If modular, define all segment types and tags
3. **Meta-story timeline** — Visual representation of the biblical narrative arc
4. **Interactive element library** — Specific breath prayers, journaling prompts, etc.
5. **Founder review** — Theological accuracy, voice/tone approval
6. **Production pipeline** — How will 365+ devotionals actually get created?

---

## Open Questions

1. **Who writes/generates?** Founder, AI, combination? What's the review process?
2. **Modular vs. Full Essays?** Are we stitching segments or generating complete essays?
3. **The 365 passage selection** — Which passages for which days? (Bible reading plan needed)
4. **Hero images** — Does each devotional need a visual? Who creates?
5. **Launch scope** — All 365 at launch, or start with a subset?

---

## Citation Requirements

**All EUONGELION content must use endnote citations.**

- Superscript numbers in text¹²³
- Full citations at end of each devotional
- Every factual claim, quote, or scholarly insight requires citation
- Use respected theological sources (see THEOLOGICAL-RESOURCES.md)

**Example:**

```
The Hebrew word *hevel* appears 38 times in Ecclesiastes, painting a picture of
life's apparent meaninglessness.¹
