# Three Content Pitches: Filling the Gaps

**Date:** January 16, 2026
**Purpose:** Strategic content recommendations based on gap analysis

---

## The Context

Based on analysis from multiple agents, EUONGELION has:

**Strengths:**

- Excellent narrative structure (PaRDeS + Chiasm)
- 365 Through-the-Bible plan (planned)
- Strong emotional/experiential content
- Hebrew/Greek word studies
- Modern stories that illuminate

**Critical Gaps Identified:**

1. No comprehensive apologetics
2. No explicit doctrinal foundations
3. No spiritual disciplines teaching
4. No hermeneutics explanation (PaRDeS is used but not taught)
5. No church history
6. Limited Jewish roots beyond word studies

---

## Three Pitches

Each addresses a different strategic need with a different motivation.

---

## PITCH 1: "The Defender's Path"

### Comprehensive Apologetics Library

**Motivation:** REACH THE UNREACHABLE

The current content assumes a baseline willingness to engage spiritually. But some people won't open a devotional until their intellectual barriers are addressed. Soul Audit will identify these users—and currently has nowhere to send them.

**The Problem:**

- "I have doubts about God's existence" → No content
- "I'm exploring Islam and Christianity" → No content
- "The Bible seems untrustworthy" → No content
- "Science has disproved religion" → No content

These are real people with real questions. They type into Soul Audit and hit a dead end.

**The Solution: Six Apologetics Series (98 days total)**

| Series                                    | Days | Addresses                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Why Believe?                              | 21   | Atheism, existence of God, problem of evil           |
| Jesus According to Islam and Christianity | 14   | Islam, comparative claims about Christ               |
| The Jewish Roots of Christianity          | 21   | Judaism, why Jews don't believe, rabbinic tradition  |
| One Way, Many Questions                   | 14   | Spiritual but not religious, all paths, universalism |
| Can We Trust the Bible?                   | 14   | Historicity, manuscripts, reliability                |
| Faith and Science                         | 14   | Evolution, miracles, Christianity and science        |

**Why This Matters for EUONGELION:**

1. **Expands reach** — Currently cannot serve intellectually-driven seekers
2. **Differentiates** — Most devotional apps are purely emotional; this adds intellectual rigor
3. **Completes the journey** — Someone might start with apologetics and graduate to deeper devotion
4. **Serves shepherds** — Pastors and leaders get resources for answering questions

**Unique EUONGELION Advantage:**
Apply the same PaRDeS + Chiasm structure to apologetics. Don't just argue—tell the story. Hebrew word studies illuminate apologetic points. Modern stories make abstract arguments concrete.

**Sample Day: "Why Believe? Day 5 - Where Does Morality Come From?"**

```
A (Hook): You're at a dinner party. Someone says, "I don't need God to be good."
   You pause. How do you respond?

B (Scripture): "For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what
   the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not
   have the law. They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts."
   — Romans 2:14-15

C (Center): Hebrew word study on "lev" (לֵב) - heart. The moral law inscribed
   within. Greek "syneidesis" - conscience. The universal witness.

   The Argument: If morality is just evolutionary adaptation, why do we feel
   guilty when no one is watching? Why do we believe some things are really
   wrong (not just culturally disapproved)? C.S. Lewis called this "the law
   of human nature" - a clue that points beyond ourselves.¹

B' (Christ Connection): Jesus didn't come to give us a new moral code. He came
   because we couldn't keep the one written on our hearts. The gospel isn't
   "try harder" - it's "I did it for you."

A' (Return): Back at the dinner party. You don't need to win the argument.
   You need to ask the question: "Where do you think that sense of 'should'
   comes from?"

---
**Notes**
1. Lewis, C.S. *Mere Christianity*. London: Geoffrey Bles, 1952. Book I, Chapter 1.
```

**Production:**

- 98 devotionals × ~4,000 words = ~392,000 words
- One-time generation cost: ~$40-60
- Requires theological review for accuracy

**Priority:** HIGH — Without this, Soul Audit fails for a major audience segment.

---

## PITCH 2: "The Builder's Foundation"

### Doctrinal Core + Hermeneutics Teaching

**Motivation:** BUILD SOMETHING THAT LASTS

Beautiful devotionals without doctrinal foundation produce emotional Christians who don't know what they believe. They're susceptible to every wind of teaching. EUONGELION can produce more than feelings—it can produce rooted disciples.

**The Problem:**

- Users experience PaRDeS but don't know what it is
- No systematic explanation of core Christian beliefs
- New Believer series (14 days) is too short for foundations
- Users can't defend or explain their faith

**The Solution: Three Foundational Series (58 days total)**

| Series                | Days | Purpose                                                          |
| --------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How to Read the Bible | 14   | Teaches PaRDeS, literary genres, interpretation                  |
| What We Believe       | 30   | Systematic doctrine: God, Christ, salvation, church, last things |
| PaRDeS Explained      | 5    | Deep-dive on the four levels (makes the implicit explicit)       |
| Hard Doctrines        | 9    | Predestination, hell, suffering, gifts, etc.                     |

**Why This Matters for EUONGELION:**

1. **Explains the distinctive** — PaRDeS is your method. If users don't understand it, they miss the value.
2. **Prevents shallow faith** — Experience without understanding doesn't last
3. **Creates teachers** — People who understand can share with others
4. **Serves shepherds** — Leaders need systematic resources

**Sample Day: "How to Read the Bible Day 3 - What is PaRDeS?"**

```
A (Hook): You've been reading EUONGELION for a week now. You notice something.
   The devotionals seem to work on multiple levels. There's the plain meaning,
   but also hints, applications, mysteries. It's not random. It's a method
   called PaRDeS. Today you learn what it is.

B (Scripture): "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a
   matter is the glory of kings." — Proverbs 25:2

C (Center): PaRDeS (פַּרְדֵּס) - Hebrew for "orchard" or "paradise." An acronym:

   P - Peshat (פְּשָׁט) - "Simple" - The plain, literal meaning
   R - Remez (רֶמֶז) - "Hint" - Allusions, typology, what's beneath
   D - Derash (דְּרַשׁ) - "Search" - Application, moral teaching
   S - Sod (סוֹד) - "Secret" - Mystery, prophetic, deeper revelation

   This isn't a Christian invention. It's how Jewish rabbis have read Torah
   for millennia. Jesus used it. Paul used it. We're recovering ancient wisdom.¹

B' (Christ Connection): Jesus himself taught in layers. Parables had plain
   meanings and hidden depths. "To you it has been given to know the secrets
   of the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 13:11). PaRDeS isn't a trick—it's how
   God designed Scripture to be read.

A' (Return): Tomorrow, as you read, ask: What's the plain meaning? What hints
   are here? How does this apply to my life? What mystery is being revealed?
   You're not just reading. You're entering the orchard.

**Notes**
1. For an introduction to PaRDeS in Jewish interpretation, see: Stern, David H.
   *Jewish New Testament Commentary*. Clarksville, MD: Jewish New Testament
   Publications, 1992. Introduction.
```

**Production:**

- 58 devotionals × ~4,000 words = ~232,000 words
- One-time generation cost: ~$25-35
- Requires careful theological review

**Priority:** HIGH — This explains what makes EUONGELION different.

## PITCH 3: "The Practitioner's Way"

### Spiritual Disciplines + Formation

**Motivation:** TRANSFORMATION, NOT JUST INFORMATION

EUONGELION promises to help people "seek God daily." But seeking requires practices. Reading is one practice; there are others. Without teaching disciplines, you produce informed spectators, not transformed practitioners.

**The Problem:**

- Interactive elements (breath prayers, journaling) exist but aren't taught
- Users don't know HOW to pray, fast, rest
- No guidance on sustainable spiritual rhythms
- Weary shepherds burned out because they teach but don't practice

**The Solution: Three Practice-Based Series (67 days total)**

| Series                                | Days | Focus                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------- |
| The Way of Jesus: Spiritual Practices | 30   | Comprehensive overview of disciplines |
| Learn to Pray                         | 7    | Practical prayer instruction          |
| First Fast                            | 3    | Guidance for fasting                  |
| The Sabbath Gift                      | 7    | Rest as spiritual practice            |
| The Listening Life                    | 14   | Hearing God, discernment, silence     |
| Digital Sabbath                       | 6    | Faith in the attention economy        |

**Why This Matters for EUONGELION:**

1. **Delivers transformation** — Information without practice changes nothing
2. **Creates sustainability** — Rhythms prevent burnout
3. **Extends the product** — From "reading" to "living"
4. **Serves weary shepherds** — The people who need formation most

**Sample Day: "Learn to Pray Day 1 - You Don't Know How (And That's Okay)"**

```
A (Hook): Be honest. When you pray, does it feel like talking to the ceiling?
   You know you should pray. You've been told to pray. But no one ever
   taught you HOW. Today, we start from scratch. No shame. Just practice.

B (Scripture): "Lord, teach us to pray." — Luke 11:1

   Even the disciples—who walked with Jesus—had to ask. If they needed
   teaching, so do we.

C (Center): The Hebrew word for prayer is "tefilah" (תְּפִלָּה), from a root
   meaning "to judge oneself." Prayer isn't primarily asking God for things.
   It's examining yourself in His presence.

   The Greek "proseuche" (προσευχή) combines "toward" and "wish/vow."
   Moving toward God with your deepest desires.

   Prayer is not performance. It's positioning. You show up. You're honest.
   That's it.¹

B' (Christ Connection): Jesus prayed constantly. Early morning (Mark 1:35).
   All night before decisions (Luke 6:12). In agony at Gethsemane (Luke 22:44).
   He didn't need to perform for His Father. Neither do you.

A' (Return): Today's practice is simple: Set a timer for 5 minutes. Sit quietly.
   Say: "Lord, teach me to pray." Then just breathe. If words come, speak them.
   If not, just be present. That's prayer too.

[INTERACTIVE: 5-minute guided silence with breathing prompts]

```

**Production:**

- 67 devotionals × ~4,000 words = ~268,000 words
- One-time generation cost: ~$30-40
- Includes more interactive elements

**Priority:** HIGH — This is what makes devotionals work.

## Comparison Matrix

| Pitch                                | Days | Words | Cost | Audience Impact          | Differentiation     |
| ------------------------------------ | ---- | ----- | ---- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| The Defender's Path (Apologetics)    | 98   | ~392K | ~$50 | Opens door to skeptics   | Intellectual depth  |
| The Builder's Foundation (Doctrine)  | 58   | ~232K | ~$30 | Creates rooted disciples | Explains the method |
| The Practitioner's Way (Disciplines) | 67   | ~268K | ~$35 | Produces transformation  | Beyond information  |

---

## Recommendation

**Do all three, in this order:**

1. **First: The Builder's Foundation**
   - Explains PaRDeS (your distinctive)
   - Creates doctrinal foundation
   - Shortest to produce (58 days)

2. **Second: The Practitioner's Way**
   - Delivers on transformation promise
   - Teaches the "how" behind devotion
   - Serves burned-out shepherds

3. **Third: The Defender's Path**
   - Opens doors to new audiences
   - Most content (98 days)
   - Requires most theological review

**Total:** 223 devotionals, ~892,000 words, ~$115 generation cost

This would give EUONGELION:

- 365 Through-the-Bible (core)
- 223 supplementary content (these three pitches)
- 8+ audience branches (existing plan)
- 52 Story of God (existing plan)

**Total library: ~700+ devotionals**

---

## Decision Points

1. **Which pitch resonates most with the vision?**
2. **Is there budget/time for all three before MVP?**
3. **Should apologetics be in MVP or Phase 2?**
4. **Who reviews for theological accuracy?**
