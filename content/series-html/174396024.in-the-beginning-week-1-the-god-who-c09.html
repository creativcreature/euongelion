When she was 19 months old, an illness left her both deaf and blind. For six years, Helen lived in darkness and silence, unable to communicate effectively, becoming increasingly frustrated and violent when she couldn’t make herself understood. In 1887, her parents hired Anne Sullivan, a teacher who had been partially blind herself and understood Helen’s isolation.</p><p>Anne began teaching Helen by spelling words into her hand using finger spelling, but Helen didn’t understand that these movements represented words with meaning. The breakthrough came on April 5, 1887, at a water pump in the Keller family’s yard. Anne held Helen’s hand under flowing water while spelling “W-A-T-E-R” into her other hand. Suddenly, Helen understood—the finger movements weren’t random gestures but words representing real things.</p><p>Helen later described that moment: “Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten—a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me. I knew then that ‘w-a-t-e-r’ meant the wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. That living word awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free!” In that instant, her world was transformed. She immediately wanted to know the names of everything around her, learning 30 words by day’s end.</p><p>Helen became the first deaf-blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree, later writing: “Before my teacher came to me, I did not know that I am. I lived in a world that was a no-world... But when my teacher came to me, and I learned that everything has a name, and that each name gave birth to a new thought, that began to awaken my soul and set it free.” She often spoke of that water pump moment as the day she was “born again”—when language brought light to her darkness.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Just as God’s spoken word brought light into the darkness of creation, His word continues to bring light, understanding, and transformation into the darkness of human experience.</em></p><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Theological and Historical Focus: <br>The Power of Divine Speech</h4><p>Genesis 1:3 marks a pivotal moment in the creation narrative. After describing the chaotic state of the earth and the Spirit hovering over the waters, the text records God’s first spoken words. This moment establishes several crucial truths about the nature of God, the power of His word, and the relationship between speech and reality.</p><h4>The First Divine Speech</h4><p>The Hebrew phrase “Vayomer Elohim” (וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים) - “And God said” - appears ten times in Genesis 1, creating a literary structure that emphasizes the power of divine speech. The verb “amar” (אמר) means not just to speak but to say with authority and intention. When God speaks, He doesn’t merely make sounds—He exercises sovereign authority over reality itself.</p><p>The choice to begin God’s speaking with the creation of light is significant. Light is the most fundamental requirement for life as we know it. Without light, there can be no photosynthesis, no vision, no warmth, no energy. By speaking light into existence first, God establishes the foundation for all life that will follow.</p><h4>The Nature of the Command</h4><p>The Hebrew phrase “yehi or” (יְהִי אוֹר) is remarkably simple—just two words that mean “let there be light.” The verb “yehi” is in the jussive mood, which in Hebrew expresses a command, wish, or request. But when God uses the jussive, it’s not a request—it’s a sovereign decree that reality must obey.</p><p>The simplicity of the command emphasizes the effortlessness of God’s creative power. He doesn’t need complex incantations, elaborate rituals, or tremendous effort. He simply speaks, and reality conforms to His word. This stands in stark contrast to other ancient creation myths where gods struggle and strain to create.</p><h4>The Immediate Response</h4><p>The text immediately records: “vayehi or” (וַיְהִי־אוֹר) - “and there was light.” The response is instantaneous and complete. There’s no delay, no partial fulfillment, no resistance. The same verb form that God uses to command (”yehi”) is used to describe the result (”vayehi”). Reality perfectly mirrors God’s word.</p><p>This pattern—God speaks, reality responds—establishes the fundamental principle that governs all of creation. The universe operates according to the word of God. This principle extends beyond the creation week to God’s ongoing governance of creation and His work in redemption.</p><h4>The Nature of Created Light:</h4><p>The light created on Day 1 is distinct from the sun, moon, and stars, which aren’t created until Day 4. This has led to much discussion about the nature of this primordial light. Some possibilities include:</p><ol><li><p>The light of God’s presence: In 1 John 1:5, we read that “God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.” The light of Day 1 may be the manifestation of God’s own nature.</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p>Electromagnetic radiation: Modern physics understands light as electromagnetic radiation. God may have created the electromagnetic spectrum before creating the celestial bodies that would later serve as light sources.</p></li></ol><ol start="3"><li><p>The cosmic background radiation: Some have suggested this light corresponds to what cosmologists call the cosmic microwave background radiation—the afterglow of the Big Bang.</p></li></ol><p>Regardless of the specific nature of this light, its creation establishes the fundamental distinction between light and darkness, order and chaos, good and evil.</p><h4>The Connection to Christ:</h4><p>The creation of light in Genesis 1:3 points directly to Christ in multiple ways:</p><p><strong>Christ as the Word:</strong> John 1:1-3 identifies Jesus as the eternal Word through whom all things were made. When God speaks in Genesis 1:3, He speaks through the Word who is Christ. The creative power of divine speech is the power of Christ as the Word of God.</p><p><strong>Christ as the Light:</strong> In John 8:12, Jesus declares, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” The light created on Day 1 finds its ultimate expression in Christ as the Light of the world.</p><p><strong>The New Creation:</strong> In 2 Corinthians 4:6, Paul explicitly connects Genesis 1:3 to salvation: “For God, who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness,’ has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.” The same God who spoke light into the darkness of creation speaks light into the darkness of human hearts through Christ.</p><h4>The Pattern of God’s Work:</h4><p>Genesis 1:3 establishes a pattern that we see throughout Scripture:<br><em>•God speaks<br>•Reality responds<br>•Order emerges from chaos<br>•Life becomes possible</em></p><p>This pattern is repeated in:<br><em>•The calling of Abraham (Genesis 12:1-3)<br>•The deliverance from Egypt (Exodus 14)<br>•The resurrection of Christ (Romans 1:4)<br>•The conversion of believers (2 Corinthians 5:17)</em></p><h4>The Ecclesiastes Connection</h4><p>The light of Genesis 1:3 stands in contrast to the darkness that Solomon describes in Ecclesiastes. In Ecclesiastes 2:13, he writes, “Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light than in darkness.” The light that God speaks into creation represents wisdom, truth, and life—the very things that make existence meaningful rather than vain.</p><p>Ecclesiastes 11:7 declares, “Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun.” The light that began in Genesis 1:3 continues to be a source of joy and blessing, pointing us toward the ultimate Light who gives meaning to all existence.</p><h4>The Authority of God’s Word</h4><p>Genesis 1:3 establishes the absolute authority of God’s word. When God speaks, reality has no choice but to obey. This truth has profound implications for how we approach Scripture. The same word that created light continues to have creative power in our lives.</p><p>Isaiah 55:11 declares, “So shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.” The word that spoke light into existence continues to accomplish God’s purposes in the world today.</p><h4>Why This Matters for Us</h4><p>Genesis 1:3 teaches us that God’s word has creative power. When we feel surrounded by darkness—whether spiritual, emotional, or circumstantial—we can remember that the same God who spoke light into the primordial darkness can speak light into our darkness.</p><p>This verse also reminds us of the power of words themselves. As image-bearers of God, our words have power to create or destroy, to bring light or darkness, to build up or tear down. We’re called to use our words the way God uses His—to bring order, beauty, and life into the world around us.</p><h3>Optional Language Learning</h3><p><strong>Hebrew Context: </strong>The Power of Divine Speech</p><p><strong>Key Words from Genesis 1:3: </strong><br>• וַיֹּאמֶר (vayomer): “and he said” - from the root אמר (amar), to say with authority <br>• יְהִי (yehi): “let there be” - jussive form of היה (hayah), to be <br>• אוֹר (or): “light” - fundamental to life and vision <br>• וַיְהִי (vayehi): “and there was” - perfect response to God’s command</p><p><strong>New Hebrew Letters:</strong><br><strong>•ל (Lamed):</strong> Makes “l” sound, means “to” or “toward,” represents learning<br><strong>•מ (Mem):</strong> Makes “m” sound, means “water,” represents chaos and life<br><strong>•ע (Ayin): </strong>Silent or slight guttural, means “eye,” represents seeing<br><strong>•ן (Nun final):</strong> Final form of Nun, used at end of words</p><p><strong>Grammar Notes:</strong><br><em>•The verb “amar” (to say) implies authoritative speech, not casual conversation<br>•The jussive mood expresses commands that must be obeyed<br>•Hebrew often uses the same root for command and fulfillment (yehi/vayehi)<br>•The conjunction “vav” (ו) connects God’s word to immediate reality</em></p><p><strong>Word Study:</strong> The root אור (or) appears throughout Scripture:<br>•<em>Genesis 1:3 - physical light<br>•Psalm 119:105 - God’s word as light<br>•Isaiah 9:2 - messianic light<br>•John 8:12 - Christ as light</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>What “darkness” in your life needs God to speak light into it?
