So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.”</p></blockquote><p>— Genesis 2:18, 21-22 (ESV)</p><blockquote><p>“Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her...”</p></blockquote><p>— Ephesians 5:25 (ESV)</p><h2>Quickstart</h2><p>The pinnacle of God’s creative work was not a solitary individual, but a community. After declaring everything else “good,” God makes the first and only declaration of “not good”: for man to be alone. The solution was not just a companion, but a “helper fit for him” (ezer kenegdo), a partner who was both his equal and his complement. This reveals that we were created for relationship, for community, for a partnership that reflects the very nature of the triune God.</p><h2>Reflection</h2><p>Who is the “helper” God has placed in your life? This could be a spouse, a close friend, a mentor, or a creative partner. How has that person helped you become more fully yourself? Take a moment to thank God for that person and to consider how you can be a better “helper” to them in return.</p><p>Take a moment.</p><p>You were not created to be alone; you were created for community.</p><h2>Prayer</h2><blockquote><p>“Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: <br>If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up.”</p></blockquote><p>— Ecclesiastes 4:9–10 (NIV)</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bosF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52465056-ea08-4059-8275-9fd66c409a99_1456x816.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bosF!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52465056-ea08-4059-8275-9fd66c409a99_1456x816.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bosF!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52465056-ea08-4059-8275-9fd66c409a99_1456x816.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bosF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52465056-ea08-4059-8275-9fd66c409a99_1456x816.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bosF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52465056-ea08-4059-8275-9fd66c409a99_1456x816.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/52465056-ea08-4059-8275-9fd66c409a99_1456x816.jpeg" width="1456" height="816" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/52465056-ea08-4059-8275-9fd66c409a99_1456x816.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:816,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:247120,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/i/184167600?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52465056-ea08-4059-8275-9fd66c409a99_1456x816.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bosF!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52465056-ea08-4059-8275-9fd66c409a99_1456x816.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bosF!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52465056-ea08-4059-8275-9fd66c409a99_1456x816.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bosF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52465056-ea08-4059-8275-9fd66c409a99_1456x816.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bosF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52465056-ea08-4059-8275-9fd66c409a99_1456x816.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>Story: The Inklings</h2><p>In the mid-20th century, at Oxford University, two brilliant minds, C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, formed a friendship that would change the face of literature. They were both professors, both veterans of the Great War, and both lovers of myth and language. They formed a small, informal group of like-minded friends called “The Inklings.” They would meet on Thursday nights in Lewis’s rooms at Magdalen College, sharing drinks, conversation, and, most importantly, their own creative work.</p><p>It was in this circle of trust and honest feedback that two of the greatest fantasy worlds of all time were born. Tolkien would read aloud from his sprawling, epic manuscript, a story of hobbits and elves and a dark lord in the land of Mordor. Lewis would share chapters from his own imaginative tales, stories of talking animals and a magical land called Narnia. The other members of the group would listen, critique, and encourage. They were “helpers,” partners in the creative process, sharpening each other’s ideas and pushing each other toward excellence.</p><p>Lewis and Tolkien were profoundly different in their personalities and their faith, but they were united by a shared love of story and a deep respect for each other’s gifts. Tolkien’s Catholic faith was instrumental in Lewis’s conversion from atheism to Christianity. Lewis’s encouragement was a key factor in Tolkien’s decision to persevere with his massive, unconventional novel, “The Lord of the Rings.” They were an ezer kenegdo for each other, a helper and a partner who, together, created something that neither could have created alone. Their friendship is a powerful testament to the truth that we are made for community, that our greatest works are often born out of the soil of deep, committed relationships.</p><p>Takeaway: We are created for community, and our greatest potential is unlocked when we find our “helpers” and partners in the journey.</p><h2>Go Deeper</h2><h3>Scripture Reading</h3><p>Genesis 2:18, 21-22 (ESV)</p><blockquote><p>18 Then the Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.”...</p><p>21 So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.</p><p>22 And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.</p></blockquote><p>Ephesians 5:25, 31-32 (ESV)</p><blockquote><p>25 Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her...</p><p>31 “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.”</p><p>32 This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.</p></blockquote><h3>What’s Happening in the Text?</h3><p>Genesis 2 gives us the intimate story of the creation of woman. It is the only time God declares something “not good.” The solution is an ezer kenegdo, a “helper fit for him.” Ezer is a word often used to describe God Himself as our helper (Psalm 33:20). Kenegdo means “corresponding to” or “face to face.” This is not a subordinate, but a partner of equal stature and strength.</p><p>The creation of Eve from Adam’s rib is a powerful symbol of their unity and equality. She is not made from the dust, but from his very side. She is bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. This is the foundation of human community, the “one flesh” union that is the building block of society.</p><p>In Ephesians 5, Paul quotes this passage from Genesis and then reveals the profound mystery behind it. The one-flesh union of husband and wife is a picture, a foreshadowing, of the relationship between Christ and His Church. The Church is the Bride of Christ, and He is the Bridegroom who gave Himself up for her. The community we were created for finds its ultimate expression in the body of Christ, the family of God, the community of believers united in Him.</p><h3>Key Word or Concept</h3><p><strong>Ezer Kenegdo (עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ) — A Helper Fit for Him</strong></p><p>This Hebrew phrase is notoriously difficult to translate, but it is rich with meaning. Ezer means “helper,” but it is a strong, powerful kind of help, the kind that God provides. Kenegdo means “opposite him” or “corresponding to him.” It suggests a relationship of mutuality, of face-to-face partnership.</p><p>Eve was created to be Adam’s perfect counterpart, his equal in essence, his partner in the task of cultivating and keeping the garden. This is the biblical model for community: not a hierarchy of power, but a partnership of mutual love, respect, and service.</p><h3>Community Reflection</h3><p>If you’re willing, share in the comments:</p><p>Think about the “Inklings” in your own life. Who are the people who sharpen you, encourage you, and help you be more creative and fruitful? Give them a shout-out and thank them for their partnership in your journey.</p><h3>This Week’s Journey</h3><p><strong>This is Day 5 of 5.</strong></p><p>Today, we have seen that we were created for community, for a partnership that reflects the very heart of God.</p><p>This week, we have explored the two creation stories and what they reveal about our identity. We have seen that we are both cosmic royalty and intimately crafted works of art, that we are called to be image-bearers and co-gardeners, and that we are created for deep, meaningful community. This is the blueprint of humanity, the foundation upon which God builds His kingdom.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/genesis-two-stories-of-creation-deep?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Genesis Deep Dive&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/genesis-two-stories-of-creation-deep?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true"><span>Genesis Deep Dive</span></a></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong> </strong>Subscribe to get next weeks daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
