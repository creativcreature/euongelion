And God saw that it was good. God blessed them and said, ‘Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.’” — Genesis 1:20–22 (NIV)</p><p>“I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die.” — John 11:25–26 (NIV)</p><p>“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.” — John 10:10 (NIV)</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart</h2><p>After establishing order and rhythm, God’s next act is an explosion of life.</p><p>He speaks, and the waters “teem” with living creatures. The sky is filled with birds. The world, once formless and empty, is now overflowing with abundance. And for the first time, God does something new: He blesses them. The first blessing in Scripture is a command to be fruitful, to increase, to fill the earth.</p><p>God’s nature is not one of scarcity, but of extravagant generosity. He doesn’t just create life; He creates a world where life can flourish and multiply. Jesus confirms this is His own mission: to bring not just life, but life “to the full.”</p><div><hr></div><h2>Reflection</h2><p>If God’s desire for His creation is abundance, where in your life are you settling for scarcity?</p><p>Where have you accepted the lie that there is not enough—not enough time, not enough money, not enough love? What would it look like to believe that the Creator of a teeming, overflowing world wants to bring that same abundance into your life?</p><p><strong>Take a moment.</strong> God’s blessing is not a limited resource. It is an overflowing fountain.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Prayer</h2><blockquote><p>“You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance. The grasslands of the wilderness overflow; the hills are clothed with joy. The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing.” — Psalm 65:11–13 (NIV)</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><div

watched as the 33 miners of San José were brought to the surface. One by one, they ascended in a specially designed capsule named the <em>Fénix</em> (Phoenix), a symbol of rebirth from the darkness. The rescue was a marvel of engineering and international cooperation, but it was more than that. It was a global celebration of life. As each man emerged from the capsule, blinking in the sunlight, he was greeted with cheers, tears, and the embrace of his family. The world, so often divided, was united in a moment of shared joy.</p><p>The miners, who had survived on meager rations in the depths of the earth, were now met with an outpouring of abundance. They were offered jobs, book deals, and invitations to travel the world. Their story, born in a place of scarcity and death, had become a source of inspiration and blessing for millions. They had been to the depths of the earth, and they had returned, not just with their lives, but with a story to tell, a testimony to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of hope.</p><p>This is the culmination of God’s creative work. He does not just rescue us from the void; He brings us into a place of abundance. The story of the 33 miners is a modern parable of the Gospel. We were all trapped in the darkness, with no hope of escape. But God, in His mercy, sent a light into our darkness, established a boundary to protect us, gave us a rhythm to live by, and finally, brought us out into a life of overflowing abundance. The rescue of the 33 was not just an event; it was a picture of the God who delights in bringing life out of death, and who promises not just survival, but life to the full.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: In a world of scarcity and death, the most defiant act is to create something beautiful.</strong></p><div><hr></div><h2>Go Deeper</h2><h4>Scripture Reading</h4><p><strong>Genesis 1:20–23 (NIV)</strong></p><blockquote><p>20 And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.” 21 So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” 23 And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.</p></blockquote><p><strong>John 10:10 (NIV)</strong></p><blockquote><p>10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h4>What’s Happening in the Text?</h4><p>On Day 5, creation reaches a new level of complexity and beauty. The world is filled with “living creatures” (<em>nephesh chayyāh</em>), a term that implies not just biological life, but soul and personality. For the first time, God is creating beings that can move, interact, and experience the world.</p><p>And for the first time, God blesses His creation. The word for bless, <em>barak</em>, is a powerful one in Hebrew. It means to empower, to enrich, to grant success. God’s first blessing is a command to be fruitful and multiply, to fill the earth with life. This reveals God’s fundamental desire for His creation: He wants it to flourish.</p><p>Jesus echoes this desire in John 10:10. He contrasts His own mission with that of the “thief” (a symbol of the forces of sin and death). The thief’s goal is to diminish life, to steal joy, to bring destruction. Jesus’ goal is the opposite: to bring life in its most abundant, overflowing, and complete form.</p><p>But Jesus goes even further in John 11:25–26, declaring, “I am the resurrection and the life.” This is not just a promise of abundant life now; it is a promise of eternal life. The 33 miners were rescued from a tomb, but they will one day face death again. Jesus offers a rescue that transcends even death itself. He is the source of all life—the <em>nephesh chayyāh</em> that filled the seas on Day 5 flows from Him. And He promises that those who believe in Him will never truly die. The blessing God spoke over creation on Day 5 finds its ultimate fulfillment in the resurrection power of Jesus Christ.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Key Word or Concept</h2><p><em><strong>Barak</strong></em><strong> (בָּרַךְ)</strong> — translated as “to bless.”</p><p>In the ancient world, a blessing was not just a nice sentiment. It was a transfer of power. When a king blessed his subjects, he was granting them his favor and protection. When a father blessed his son, he was transferring his authority and inheritance.</p><p>When God blesses His creation, He is imparting His own creative power to it. He is inviting His creatures to participate in His work of filling the world with life. This is a radical idea. The God of the universe is not a distant, aloof deity. He is a generous king who delights in sharing His power with His creation.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Community Reflection</h2><p><em>If you’re willing, share in the comments:</em></p><blockquote><p>Where have you seen God’s abundance in your life this week?</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>This Week’s Journey</h2><p><strong>This is Day 5 of 5.</strong></p><p>This week, we have journeyed from the formless void to a world teeming with life.
