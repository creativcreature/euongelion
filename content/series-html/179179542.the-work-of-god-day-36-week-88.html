Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.’” - John 6:35</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Passage:</strong> John 6:34-35 - “Then Jesus declared, ‘I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.’”</p><p><strong>Greek Phrase:</strong> ἐγώ εἰμι (egō eimi) - “I am.” This is a powerful declaration of divine identity, echoing God’s name, Yahweh, revealed in Exodus 3:14. When Jesus says, “I am the bread of life,” he is not just saying what he does; he is declaring who he is.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>What am I currently using as a substitute “bread of life” to satisfy my spiritual hunger? How is it failing to deliver on its promise?</p><p><strong>Urgency Moment: </strong>Stop snacking on spiritual junk food. Today, consciously turn away from one thing you use to numb your spiritual hunger (e.g., social media, entertainment, busyness) and spend that time feasting on the presence of Christ through prayer or Scripture.</p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“Jesus, you are the bread of life. Forgive me for trying to satisfy my soul with things that can never last. I come to you today, hungry and thirsty. Satisfy me with yourself.”</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Liam watched as his family began to pack up their leftovers, dividing the remains of the Thanksgiving feast into containers. There was so much food, yet he knew that by tomorrow, it would be gone. The satisfaction was temporary. It was just manna.</p><p>He thought about his conversation with his father on the porch. It hadn’t been a dramatic, movie-like moment of reconciliation. His father had simply listened, nodded, and then said, “I’m tired, son. I’m just tired of it all.”</p><p>It was a simple admission, but it was more honest than anything Liam had ever heard him say. It was a confession of a deep, unsatisfied hunger, a weariness that no amount of business success could cure.</p><p>Later that evening, as the house grew quiet, Liam found his father in the living room, looking at old family photo albums. Liam sat down beside him.</p><p>“You know,” his father said, pointing to a picture of a much younger version of himself, standing proudly in front of his first office, “I thought that was it. I thought if I could just build this business, provide for my family, make a name for myself... I thought that would be enough. I thought that would be the bread that would make me feel full.”</p><p>He sighed, a deep, weary sound. “But the hunger never goes away. You just get hungrier for more. More success, more recognition, more security. It’s a treadmill.”</p><p>Liam, feeling a boldness he didn’t know he had, replied, “Jesus said, ‘I am the bread of life.’ He didn’t say, ‘I will give you bread.’ He said he is the bread. The satisfaction isn’t in what he gives us—success, health, a good life. The satisfaction is in him.”</p><p>His father was quiet for a long time. He slowly turned the pages of the album, past the pictures of business openings and awards, until he came to a photo of Liam’s baptism as a child. He stared at the picture, at the image of his young son, full of a simple, uncomplicated faith.</p><p>“Maybe you’re right,” his father said, his voice thick with emotion. “Maybe I’ve been eating the wrong bread my whole life.”</p><p>It wasn’t a conversion. It wasn’t a dramatic turnaround. But it was a crack in the armor. It was the beginning of a new kind of hunger, a hunger for something real, something that would last. It was a turning away from the temporary manna of the world and a turning toward the true bread of life.</p><p>Liam felt a profound sense of peace. The need to prove himself, to perform, to bring his own achievements to the family feast, had vanished. He had nothing to offer but his own hunger, and he was beginning to realize that was the only thing required. He had come to the feast empty-handed, only to find that the feast itself was being offered to him.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> True, lasting satisfaction is not found in the gifts God gives, but in God himself. Jesus is not just the provider of the bread; he is the bread of life.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Practical and Theological Focus:<br>Jesus as the Source of Ultimate Satisfaction</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: John 6:25-40 (NIV)</strong><br><em>25 When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” 26 Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. 27 Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.” 28 Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” 29 Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.” 30 So they asked him, “What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? 31 Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” 32 Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” 34 “Sir,” they said, “always give us this bread.” 35 Then Jesus declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. 36 But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. 37 All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. 38 For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. 39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. 40 For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.”</em></p></blockquote><h4>The “I Am” Declaration</h4><p>Jesus’s statement, “I am the bread of life” (ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ἄρτος τῆς ζωῆς, egō eimi ho artos tēs zōēs), is the first of seven such “I am” statements in John’s Gospel. These are not casual descriptions. The phrase ἐγώ εἰμι is a direct echo of God’s revelation of his covenant name to Moses in Exodus 3:14. When Jesus uses this phrase, he is making a claim to divine identity. He is saying, “I am the personal, self-existent God, present and active among you.”</p><p>By linking this divine name to “the bread of life,” Jesus is claiming to be the ultimate source of all spiritual nourishment and satisfaction.</p><h4>The Double Promise</h4><p><strong>Jesus attaches a double promise to this declaration:</strong></p><ol><li><p>”Whoever comes to me will never go hungry.” This speaks to the deepest longings and desires of the human heart—the hunger for meaning, purpose, love, and acceptance. Jesus claims that a personal relationship with him satisfies this hunger completely and permanently.</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p>”Whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.” This addresses our spiritual thirst—the thirst for righteousness, for forgiveness, for a right relationship with God. Jesus claims that belief in him quenches this thirst forever.</p></li></ol><p>The parallelism of “coming to me” and “believing in me” shows that these are two sides of the same coin. True belief is not just intellectual assent; it is an active coming to Jesus, a personal entrusting of oneself to him.</p><h4>Old Testament Connection</h4><p>Jesus’s claim to be the source of ultimate satisfaction is a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament. The prophets often spoke of a future time when God would satisfy the deepest longings of his people.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Isaiah 55:1-2: </strong><em>“Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat! ... Why spend money on what is not bread, and your labor on what does not satisfy? Listen, listen to me, and eat what is good, and you will delight in the richest of fare.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Jesus is now claiming to be the fulfillment of this invitation. He is the “richest of fare,” the one who truly satisfies. The invitation to “come, buy and eat” is fulfilled in his call to “come to me and believe.”</p><h4>The Nature of Spiritual Satisfaction</h4><p>It is important to understand what Jesus is not promising. He is not promising that believers will never be physically hungry or thirsty. He is not promising a life free from hardship, desire, or struggle. He is promising that in him, we can find a deep, abiding satisfaction of the soul that transcends our physical and emotional circumstances.</p><p>This is the satisfaction that the apostle Paul spoke of in Philippians 4:12-13: “I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation... I can do all this through him who gives me strength.” Paul’s contentment was not based on his circumstances, but on his relationship with Christ.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>What are the things you are currently “hungry” and “thirsty” for in a spiritual sense (e.g., peace, purpose, forgiveness, acceptance)? How does Jesus’s promise to be the bread of life speak to those specific longings?</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p>What does it practically mean for you to “come to” Jesus and “believe in” him on a daily basis? What habits or practices help you to feast on the bread of life?</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h3>Share Your Thoughts</h3><p>How have you experienced Jesus as the “bread of life” in your own life? When has he satisfied a deep spiritual hunger or thirst in a way that nothing else could?</p><div><hr></div><h2>Greek Language Learning: Week 8, Day 3</h2><h4>The Language of Divine Identity</h4><p>Today, we focus on the monumental phrase at the heart of Jesus’s claim: ἐγώ εἰμι (egō eimi).</p><p><strong>The “I Am” Statement:</strong><br>ἐγώ (egō) - “I” (emphatic)<br>εἰμί (eimi) - “I am”<br>ἐγώ εἰμι (egō eimi) - “I am.” In the context of John’s Gospel, this is a claim to divine identity, echoing the Greek translation of God’s name in Exodus 3:14.</p><p><strong>Hunger and Thirst:</strong><br>πεινάω (peinaō) - “I hunger”<br>διψάω (dipsaō) - “I thirst”<br>λιμός (limos) - “famine,” “hunger”</p><p><strong>Coming and Believing:</strong><br>ἔρχομαι (erchomai) - “I come,” “I go”<br>πιστεύω (pisteuō) - “I believe,” “I trust”</p><h4>Reading Practice</h4><p>ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ἄρτος τῆς ζωῆς· ὁ ἐρχόμενος πρός με οὐ μὴ πεινάσῃ, καὶ ὁ πιστεύων εἰς ἐμὲ οὐ μὴ διψήσῃ πώποτε. <br>(egō eimi ho artos tēs zōēs; ho erchomenos pros me ou mē peinasē, kai ho pisteuōn eis eme ou mē dipsēsē pōpote.) <br>“I am the bread of life; the one who comes to me shall not hunger, and the one who believes in me shall never thirst.”</p><h4>Grammar Note: The Emphatic Double Negative</h4><p>οὐ μὴ (ou mē) is a strong, emphatic double negative in Greek. It means “by no means,” “never ever,” or “in no way.” When Jesus says, “whoever comes to me will by no means hunger,” he is making the strongest possible promise of complete and permanent satisfaction.</p><h4>Memory Tip</h4><p>Remember that ἐγώ εἰμι is the ultimate statement of identity. Jesus is not just a teacher or a prophet; he is the great “I Am,” the source of all being and life.</p><h4>Practice Exercise</h4><p><strong>Match the promise to the action:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Whoever comes to me... = ?</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p>Whoever believes in me... = ?</p></li></ol><p><em>Answers: 1. “will never go hungry,” 2. “will never be thirsty”</em></p><p>Tomorrow, we will explore the difficult reality that despite Jesus’s clear claims and promises, some people still do not believe, and we will delve into the mysterious interplay between divine sovereignty and human responsibility.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Coming Tomorrow...</h3><p>Jesus confronts the crowd with their unbelief, even though they have seen him with their own eyes. He then speaks of the Father’s sovereign role in drawing people to himself. How do we reconcile God’s sovereignty with our own free will and responsibility to believe?</p><p><em><strong>Don’t miss Day 4:</strong> All That the Father Gives Me</em></p><div><hr></div><p><em>This is Day 3 of our 6-day series “The Personal Implications.” [<a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/the-work-of-god-day-16-week-88?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">Day 1</a>] | [<a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/the-work-of-god-day-26-week-88?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">Day 2</a>] | [Day 3] | Coming Tomorrow: Day 4 - All That the Father Gives Me</em></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 4: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
