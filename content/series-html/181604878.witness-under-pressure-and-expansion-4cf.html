His certainty collapses. His identity is dismantled. His future is rewritten.</p><p>This is not a gentle conversion story.<br>It is a confrontation.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Today’s Scripture: Acts 9:1–19 (NIV)</strong></h2><blockquote><p><em>1 Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord’s disciples. He went to the high priest<br>2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem.<br>3 As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.<br>4 He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?”<br>5 “Who are you, Lord?” Saul asked.<br>“I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,” he replied.<br>6 “Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”<br>7 The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone.<br>8 Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus.<br>9 For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.</em></p><p><em>10 In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, “Ananias!”<br>“Yes, Lord,” he answered.</em></p><p><em>11 The Lord told him, “Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.<br>12 In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.”</em></p><p><em>13 “Lord,” Ananias answered, “I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem.<br>14 And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.”</em></p><p><em>15 But the Lord said to Ananias, “Go! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel.<br>16 I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.”</em></p><p><em>17 Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord—Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here—has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”<br>18 Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,<br>19 and after taking some food, he regained his strength.</em></p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Greek Word</strong></h2><p><strong>ἐκλογῆς (eklogēs)</strong> — “chosen instrument” (Acts 9:15)</p><p>This word implies <em>deliberate selection for a specific purpose</em>.<br>Saul is not rehabilitated by accident.<br>He is interrupted by design.</p><p>God does not wait for Saul to soften.<br>He confronts him head-on.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>What’s Happening in Acts 9?</strong></h2><p>Acts 9 shatters a dangerous assumption:<br>that sincerity equals righteousness.</p><p>Saul is not confused.<br>He is not half-hearted.<br>He is not seeking Jesus.</p><p>He is convinced he is serving God.</p><p>And Jesus meets him anyway.</p><p>This encounter teaches us:</p><p>• Zeal does not guarantee truth<br>• Opposition does not limit God’s reach<br>• Conversion often begins with collapse</p><p>Saul loses his sight before he gains vision.<br>He is led by the hand before he ever leads others.<br>The church he hunted must now welcome him.</p><p>Grace does not erase consequences.<br>But it does create futures.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Reflection Question</strong></h2><p>Where might I be confidently wrong — sincere, committed, and still resistant to what God is actually doing?</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Urgency Moment</strong></h2><p>Today, pray this dangerous prayer:</p><p>“Jesus, if there is any place where I am resisting You while believing I am obeying You, interrupt me.”</p><p>Then sit with the silence.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Prayer</strong></h2><p>“Risen Jesus, You are not threatened by my certainty or my confusion. You see me fully, and You still call my name. Interrupt what needs to fall apart so that You can rebuild what is true.

around Subiaco, Benedict of Nursia climbed a mountain called Monte Cassino.</p><p>There, he encountered something familiar: ruins.</p><p>A pagan temple once stood on the site. It had already collapsed. Benedict built a monastery in its place, not as conquest, but as continuity. He understood something Saul would later learn as Paul: God does not discard the world. He redeems it.</p><p>At Monte Cassino, Benedict finally wrote what he had been living.</p><p><em>The Rule.</em></p><p>It was not flashy. It did not promise success. It assumed failure, weakness, conflict, and fatigue. That was the point.</p><p>The Rule was built for ordinary people trying to live faithfully over a lifetime.</p><p>It required:</p><p>• obedience without domination<br>• humility without self-erasure<br>• stability instead of constant escape<br>• repentance as a daily practice</p><p>Benedict knew something Saul would soon discover: transformation does not happen in a moment alone. It happens through sustained obedience after the moment.</p><p>The cave had formed Benedict.<br>The communities had refined him.<br>Now the Rule would outlast him.</p><p>Like Saul, Benedict was not chosen because he was impressive.<br>He was chosen because he was interruptible.</p><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong><br>God’s interruptions are not punishments. They are invitations into truer formation.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Dive Further (5 Minutes)</strong></h2><p>Acts 9 teaches us four critical truths:</p><p><strong>1. God confronts enemies, not just seekers.</strong><br>Jesus does not wait for Saul to repent. He initiates.</p><p><strong>2. Conversion includes community.</strong><br>Saul needs Ananias. Independence is not holiness.</p><p><strong>3. Calling includes suffering.</strong><br>God names Saul’s mission and its cost in the same breath.</p><p><strong>4. Trust takes time.</strong><br>The church hesitates. Fear is understandable. Grace is patient.</p><p>If you want to see how Acts 6–12 fits into the broader movement of this week, return to the <strong>Week 4 Master Document</strong> for the full narrative arc behind today’s passage.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Coming Tomorrow: Day 5 — Acts 10–12: When God Redraws the Boundaries</strong></h3><p>The gospel crosses its final internal barrier.<br>The church learns that obedience sometimes means unlearning.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/witness-under-pressure-and-expansion?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Master Document&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/witness-under-pressure-and-expansion?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true"><span>Master Document</span></a></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 5: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
