Gentiles receive the Holy Spirit. The church wrestles honestly with change. Persecution intensifies. God intervenes. And the Word continues to spread.</p><p>This is the week’s turning point.<br>Nothing goes back to how it was before.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Today’s Scripture (Core Passage): Acts 10:34–48 (NIV)</strong></h2><p>34 Then Peter began to speak: “I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism<br>35 but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right.<br>36 You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, announcing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.</p><p>37 You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached—<br>38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.</p><p>39 “We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross,<br>40 but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen.</p><p>41 He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.<br>42 He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead.<br>43 All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”</p><p>44 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.<br>45 The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles.<br>46 For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God.</p><p>Then Peter said,<br>47 “Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water. They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.”<br>48 So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Greek Word</strong></h2><p><strong>πρόσωπολήμπτης (prosōpolēmptēs)</strong> — “one who shows partiality” (Acts 10:34)</p><p>Peter’s confession is seismic.<br>God does not sort people the way humans do.<br>No ethnicity.<br>No religious pedigree.<br>No social boundary.</p><p>This is not God expanding the club.<br>This is God redefining the people.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>What’s Happening in Acts 10–12?</strong></h2><p>These chapters do three things at once:</p><p><strong>Acts 10</strong><br>God dismantles Peter’s categories. Gentiles receive the Spirit without converting to Judaism first. Heaven moves faster than human permission.</p><p><strong>Acts 11</strong><br>The church argues. Listens. Discerns. Then says something remarkable:<br>“So then, even to Gentiles God has granted repentance that leads to life.”</p><p><strong>Acts 12</strong><br>Persecution becomes state-sponsored. James is executed. Peter is imprisoned. The church prays. God intervenes. Herod falls. The Word advances.</p><p>Acts 12 ends with quiet defiance:</p><p>“But the word of God continued to spread and flourish.”</p><p>Empires rise. Apostles die.<br>The gospel keeps moving.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Reflection Question</strong></h2><p>Where might God be inviting me to release categories, assumptions, or boundaries I thought were essential to faithfulness?</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Urgency Moment</strong></h2><p>Today, ask God this:</p><p>“Lord, who am I tempted to exclude that You may already be welcoming?”</p><p>Sit with whatever comes up without defending yourself.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Prayer</strong></h2><p>“God of all nations, forgive me for confusing my comfort with Your will. Teach me to recognize Your Spirit even when You move outside my expectations. Give me humility to follow where You lead, courage to change when You speak, and trust that Your Kingdom is wider than my understanding.”<br>Amen.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Story Time (5

the year 547.</p><p>He never traveled far.<br>He never preached publicly.<br>He never sought influence.</p><p>And yet, his Rule quietly reshaped Europe.</p><p>As the Roman Empire collapsed, Benedictine monasteries became places of:</p><p>• learning when schools disappeared<br>• hospitality when roads became dangerous<br>• stability when everything felt temporary<br>• prayer when fear dominated</p><p>Kings rose and fell. Borders shifted. Languages changed.<br>The monasteries remained.</p><p>Benedict understood what Peter learned in Acts 10 and what the church experienced in Acts 12:</p><p>God’s work is not sustained by power, protection, or proximity to authority.<br>It is sustained by obedience, humility, prayer, and trust.</p><p>Benedict did not try to preserve Rome.<br>He practiced faithfulness.</p><p>And through that faithfulness, God preserved far more than Benedict could have imagined.</p><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong><br>When God redraws the boundaries, He is not shrinking His people.<br>He is securing their future.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Dive Further (5 Minutes)</strong></h2><p>Acts 10–12 leaves us with four anchors:</p><p><strong>1. God leads before we approve.</strong><br>The Spirit falls before baptism. Heaven moves first.</p><p><strong>2. The church must discern together.</strong><br>Acts 11 shows honest disagreement handled faithfully.</p><p><strong>3. Prayer is not passive.</strong><br>The church prays. Chains fall. Doors open.</p><p><strong>4. The mission outlives the messengers.</strong><br>James dies. Peter escapes. The Word spreads.</p><p>This is how Acts works.<br>Faithfulness first.<br>Outcome later.</p><p>If you want to revisit the full arc of <strong>Acts 6–12</strong>, return to the <strong>Week 4 Master Document</strong> to see how today’s passage completes this chapter of the story.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Weekly Wrap-Up: The Pattern Is Set</strong></h2><p>This week showed us:</p><p>• leadership under pressure<br>• courage in suffering<br>• truth spoken without defense<br>• boundaries dissolved by grace<br>• prayer that moves heaven</p><p>The church is no longer confined to Jerusalem.<br>The gospel is no longer culturally contained.<br>And the mission is no longer reversible.</p><p><strong>Next Week: Acts 13–19</strong><br>The gospel goes global.<br>Paul steps forward.<br>The world responds.</p><p>If you want the daily devotions delivered automatically, you can subscribe so <strong>Week 5 begins in your inbox Monday morning</strong>.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/witness-under-pressure-and-expansion?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Master Document&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/witness-under-pressure-and-expansion?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true"><span>Master Document</span></a></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong> </strong>Subscribe to get next weeks daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
