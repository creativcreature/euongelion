For eight weeks, we have journeyed together, moving from skeptical inquiry to personal implication. We have examined the historical reliability of the Gospels, wrestled with the identity of Jesus, explored the nature of belief, and counted the cost of discipleship. This week, we have focused on the most personal aspect of the gospel: Jesus as the Bread of Life, the one who satisfies our deepest hunger and secures our eternal destiny. Today, we bring it all to a close. We will review the profound truths of John 6 and our entire series, and we will conclude, as this Thanksgiving week demands, with a response of heartfelt gratitude.</p><div

him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.” - John 6:40</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Passage:</strong> John 6:25-40 - “For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.”</p><p><strong>Greek Word:</strong> εὐχαριστία (eucharistia) - “thanksgiving,” “gratitude.” This is the root of the word “Eucharist,” another name for Communion or the Lord’s Supper. Our ultimate response to the gift of the Bread of Life is profound eucharistia.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>As I look back on this 8-week journey, what is the single most important truth I have learned, and what am I most thankful for?</p><p><strong>Urgency Moment:</strong> Don’t let this journey end here. Today, make a specific plan to continue feasting on the Bread of Life. Choose a book of the Bible to study next, find a community to discuss these truths with, or commit to a daily practice of prayer and reflection.</p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“Father, thank you. Thank you for sending your Son, the true Bread from heaven. Jesus, thank you for giving your life to satisfy my deepest hunger and secure my eternal hope. Holy Spirit, thank you for opening my eyes to this truth. Fill my heart with a gratitude that overflows into every area of my life.”</em></p><div><hr></div><h2>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h2><p>The Thanksgiving weekend was coming to a close. The leftovers were packed away, and the guests were beginning to leave. Liam stood on the porch, watching the cars pull out of the driveway. This year, there was no sense of relief that the performance was over. Instead, there was a quiet sense of peace, of fullness.</p><p>His father came and stood beside him. “It was a good Thanksgiving,” he said. It wasn’t a question, but a statement. A simple, heartfelt declaration.</p><p>“It was,” Liam agreed.</p><p>“That thing you said,” his father began, his voice hesitant. “About the work of God being to believe. About him holding on to us. I’ve been thinking about it all weekend.”</p><p>He looked at Liam, and for the first time, Liam saw not a powerful CEO or a demanding father, but a man who was simply hungry for hope.</p><p>“I’ve spent my whole life building my own kingdom,” his father said. “And it’s empty. There’s no real bread there. I think... I think I’m ready to try a different kind of bread.”</p><p>Liam’s heart swelled with a gratitude so intense it almost hurt. It was a moment he had prayed for his entire life, but it was happening in a way he never could have planned. It wasn’t a dramatic conversion, but a quiet, humble turning. A hungry soul asking for the bread of life.</p><p>Later that night, after everyone had gone, Liam and Chloe sat by the fire, the house quiet around them. “It was a good Thanksgiving,” Chloe said, echoing his father’s words.</p><p>“The best,” Liam replied.</p><p>He thought about the journey of the past eight weeks. He had started as a skeptic, armed with questions and doubts. He had demanded evidence, wrestled with hard truths, and counted the cost. He had followed the story from the wilderness of Judea to the shores of Galilee, from the cross to the empty tomb.</p><p>And somewhere along the way, the story had become his own. The historical Jesus had become his living Lord. The intellectual belief had become a life-transforming trust. The hunger for approval had been replaced by the deep, satisfying fullness of grace.</p><p>He was no longer the man who dreaded Thanksgiving, the man who came to the feast with empty hands, hoping to scrounge for scraps of validation. He was a man who knew he was invited to the table, not because of what he brought, but because of the one who was the feast itself.</p><p>He looked at his wife, at the warm glow of the fire, at the peaceful home that was a gift of grace. He was filled with a profound sense of eucharistia. Thanksgiving. Not just for a day, but for a lifetime. Not just for the temporary manna of earthly blessings, but for the true, eternal, life-giving Bread of Life.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong>The only appropriate response to the gospel is a lifetime of gratitude. Thanksgiving is not just a holiday; it is the posture of a soul that has been satisfied by the Bread of Life.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Practical and Theological Focus:<br>A Summary of Our Journey: From Skepticism to Thanksgiving</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: John 6:25-40 (NIV)</strong><br><em>25 When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” 26 Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. 27 Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.” 28 Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” 29 Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.” 30 So they asked him, “What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? 31 Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” 32 Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” 34 “Sir,” they said, “always give us this bread.” 35 Then Jesus declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. 36 But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. 37 All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. 38 For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. 39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. 40 For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.”</em></p></blockquote><h4>Our 8-Week Journey: A Review</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Week 1: What is the Gospel?</strong> We began with Mark’s urgent account, establishing the historical foundation of our faith.</p></li><li><p><strong>Week 2: Why Jesus? </strong>We explored Luke’s orderly narrative, understanding the necessity of Christ for salvation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Week 3: What Does it Mean to Believe? </strong>We wrestled with Thomas’s doubt in John’s Gospel, learning that true faith is not the absence of questions, but a trust in the person of Christ.</p></li><li><p><strong>Week 4: What is Carrying a Cross? </strong>We counted the cost of discipleship in Matthew, understanding that following Jesus requires a radical reorientation of our lives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Week 5: Once Saved, Always Saved?</strong> We examined the nature of eternal security, finding our confidence not in our own performance, but in God’s persevering grace.</p></li><li><p><strong>Week 6: What Happens When You Repeatedly Sin? </strong>We confronted the reality of ongoing struggle, learning the difference between a life of sin and a struggle with sin, and the power of grace in our weakness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Week 7: The Nature of Belief. </strong>We took a deep dive into James 1, learning how to cultivate an unwavering, single-minded faith in the midst of trials.</p></li><li><p><strong>Week 8: The Personal Implications. </strong>We have culminated our journey with John 6, finding our ultimate satisfaction and security in Jesus, the Bread of Life.</p></li></ul><h4>The Final Invitation</h4><p>The entire 8-week journey, and indeed the entire Bible, leads to this point. It leads to the simple, profound invitation of John 6:35: “Come to me... believe in me.” It is an invitation to stop striving, to stop seeking satisfaction in food that spoils, and to find our rest, our hope, our life, and our deepest satisfaction in the person of Jesus Christ.</p><h4>A Life of Thanksgiving</h4><p>This is why we end with thanksgiving. Gratitude is the natural, spontaneous, and continuous response of a heart that has understood the gospel. We are thankful not just for what God has given us, but for who he is. <br><br><strong>We are thankful for:</strong><br><strong>The Work of God:</strong> That he has done for us what we could not do for ourselves.<br><strong>The Bread of Life: </strong>That he has satisfied our deepest hunger with himself.<br><strong>The Sovereignty of the Father: </strong>That he has chosen us and drawn us to himself.<br><strong>The Security in the Son: </strong>That he holds us fast and will never let us go.<br><strong>The Promise of the Spirit:</strong> That he gives us eternal life, a present possession that culminates in future resurrection.</p><h3>Old Testament Connection</h3><p>The appropriate response to God’s gracious provision has always been thanksgiving. The book of Psalms is filled with calls to give thanks to the Lord.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Psalm 107:1, 8-9:</strong> <em>“Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever... Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind, for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.”</em></p></blockquote><p>This is the perfect summary of our journey. We have seen God’s unfailing love and his wonderful deeds in the person of Jesus Christ. He has satisfied our thirsty souls and filled our hungry hearts with the good thing—himself. Therefore, our only fitting response is to give thanks.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>Write a letter of thanksgiving to God.

You have learned the alphabet, key vocabulary, and foundational grammar that will allow you to continue to study the New Testament in its original language.</p><p><strong>Key Concepts Reviewed:<br></strong>The Greek Alphabet<br>Nouns and Cases (Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative)<br>Verbs (Tenses, Moods, Voices)<br>Participles and Infinitives<br>Prepositions and Conjunctions</p><p><strong>Reading John 6:40 in Greek:</strong></p><p>τοῦτο γάρ ἐστιν τὸ θέλημα τοῦ πατρός μου, ἵνα πᾶς ὁ θεωρῶν τὸν υἱὸν καὶ πιστεύων εἰς αὐτὸν ἔχῃ ζωὴν αἰώνιον, καὶ ἀναστήσω αὐτὸν ἐγὼ τῇ ἐσχάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ. (touto gar estin to thelēma tou patros mou, hina pas ho theōrōn ton huion kai pisteuōn eis auton echē zōēn aiōnion, kai anastēsō auton egō tē eschatē hēmera.) “For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”</p><h4>A Final Word of Encouragement</h4><p>Learning Greek is a lifelong journey, not a destination. You have taken the first and most important steps. The goal is not to become a master of the language, but to use the language to become a better student of the Word. Continue to be curious. Continue to dig deeper. Use the tools you have learned to enrich your understanding of Scripture and to grow in your love for the one to whom all Scripture points: Jesus Christ.</p><p>Χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη. (Charis hymin kai eirēnē.) “Grace and peace to you.”</p><div><hr></div><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>Thank you for joining us for this 8-week devotional series. It has been a privilege to journey with you.
