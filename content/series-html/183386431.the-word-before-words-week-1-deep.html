Happy Gregorian New Year to you! Last year was truly a blessing. God allowed me to put together 90 different devotional posts, praise GOD! Eventually I will write about my testimony here, and what lead me to this ministry (spoiler: it was obviously the Holy Spirit). <br><br>That being said, we will start with Genesis today. This is the book that lead the Holy Spirit to interceding for me in such profound ways, and as such, I think it is time to give the book its proper due here. The focus here, is to look at the scripture with as much context as we can, specifically by utilizing the original Biblical Hebrew (not to be confused with modern Hebrew) that it was written in. <br><br>Hebrew is a truly beautiful language. We will dig deep and unearth the mysteries present in text we often take for granted. I hope this journey enlivens a curiosity for who God is and what is our place in His story. <br><br>I do also want to disclose the fact that I utilize various ai tools to help me craft these. I do not write them myself, but I do my best to bet the information and make sure it is scripturally sound. If you find any mistakes or mistruths, PLEASE LET ME KNOW! I will correct these things if they are pointed out!<br><br>Without further ado, lets get into it!<br><br>- James Parker</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fNzX!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F220c7856-9d0a-466b-ac02-cbc2256367d7_1456x816.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fNzX!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F220c7856-9d0a-466b-ac02-cbc2256367d7_1456x816.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fNzX!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F220c7856-9d0a-466b-ac02-cbc2256367d7_1456x816.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fNzX!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F220c7856-9d0a-466b-ac02-cbc2256367d7_1456x816.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fNzX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F220c7856-9d0a-466b-ac02-cbc2256367d7_1456x816.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/220c7856-9d0a-466b-ac02-cbc2256367d7_1456x816.jpeg" width="1456" height="816" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/220c7856-9d0a-466b-ac02-cbc2256367d7_1456x816.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:816,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:788440,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/i/183386431?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F220c7856-9d0a-466b-ac02-cbc2256367d7_1456x816.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fNzX!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F220c7856-9d0a-466b-ac02-cbc2256367d7_1456x816.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fNzX!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F220c7856-9d0a-466b-ac02-cbc2256367d7_1456x816.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fNzX!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F220c7856-9d0a-466b-ac02-cbc2256367d7_1456x816.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fNzX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F220c7856-9d0a-466b-ac02-cbc2256367d7_1456x816.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>Opening the Ancient Door</h2><p>Most people read the first verse of the Bible and move on. A simple statement about beginnings—ten words in English, but only seven in the original Hebrew. But what if those seven Hebrew words contain a universe of meaning that has been hidden in plain sight for thousands of years? What if the very letters themselves—the ancient pictographs that form the Hebrew text—tell a story within the story? What if the Gospel of Jesus Christ was not merely predicted in Genesis, but actually <em>encoded</em> into its opening word?</p><p>This is not speculation. This is not mysticism. This is the Word of God revealing layers upon layers of truth to those willing to look deeper. Scripture is not a flat, one-dimensional text. It is a divine hologram, where the entirety of the message is contained in every part. It is a fractal, where the same intricate patterns of redemption repeat at every level of magnification. It is the first and greatest hyperlink text, where every word, every name, and every story is connected to a thousand others, all pointing to the central reality of Jesus Christ. The deeper one goes with Jesus, the more astonishing the discoveries become. There is always another level, another mystery waiting to be unveiled, another dimension of His glory hidden in the text.</p><p><em><strong>The journey begins here, at the beginning of all beginnings, by opening a door into the mind of God.</strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h2>The Two Pillars: Where Heaven Meets Earth</h2><p>Every great structure rests on pillars. The story of Scripture rests on two—one at the dawn of the first creation, the other at the dawn of the new creation. They stand separated by thousands of years, yet they are mirrors reflecting the same eternal truth.</p><h3>The First Pillar: Genesis 1:1–5</h3><blockquote><p><em>1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. 3 And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4 God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.</em></p></blockquote><h3>The Second Pillar: John 1:1–5</h3><blockquote><p><em>1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4 In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.</em></p></blockquote><p>Notice how John, the beloved disciple who leaned on Jesus’s chest at the Last Supper, does not begin his Gospel with the birth of Christ. He does not start with miracles or teachings. He reaches back—all the way back—to the same opening words Moses used to begin the Torah. This is deliberate. This is profound. John understood something that would change how we read both passages forever: <strong>the God who spoke in Genesis is the Word who became flesh in Jesus.</strong></p><p>The story of creation and the story of redemption are not two stories. They are one story, told in two movements. And both begin with a Word.</p><div><hr></div><h2>A Universe of Fire and Light</h2><p>Modern science offers a breathtaking parallel to the events of Genesis 1. Verse 2 describes a state that is “formless and empty, darkness...over the surface of the deep.” The Hebrew for “formless and empty” is <em>tohu va-vohu</em>, a phrase that implies a chaotic, unorganized, and uninhabitable state. It is not nothingness, but a primordial soup of potential. Then, God speaks, and there is light. But notice the sequence: light exists <em>before</em> it is separated from darkness (v. 4). How can this be?</p><p>Cosmologists describe the very early universe as an opaque, superheated plasma—a sea of particles where photons (light) were constantly being absorbed and re-emitted, unable to travel freely. It was a universe filled with energy, but functionally dark because light was trapped. Only when the universe expanded and cooled enough did atoms form, allowing light to be “separated” from matter and travel across the cosmos. This event is known to scientists as the “era of recombination” or “the first light.”</p><p>Genesis, written thousands of years before modern cosmology, describes this exact sequence: a formless, dark state, the introduction of light, and then the separation of light from darkness. This is not to say the Bible is a science textbook, but that the divine author of Scripture is also the author of the laws of physics. The scientific accuracy of the text, written in a pre-scientific age, is itself a miracle, a testament to its divine origin.<br><br><strong>Below is a video describing the event scientifically known as the Photon Epoch:</strong></p><div id="youtube2-oLzpohyu8og" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;oLzpohyu8og&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oLzpohyu8og?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div><hr></div><h2>The Mystery of the Second Letter</h2><p>Here is the first question, the kind Jesus often asked to make His listeners think: Why does the Torah begin with the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet, Bet (ב), and not the first letter, Aleph (א)?</p><p>Aleph represents God—the first, the one, the source of all. It would seem natural for Scripture to begin with the letter that symbolizes the Divine. Yet it does not. It begins with Bet. Why?</p><p>The ancient rabbis wrestled with this question for centuries. And the answer, when it comes, is breathtaking in its simplicity and depth: <strong>Bet means “house.”</strong></p><p>Before God revealed His name, He built a home. Before He declared His glory, He prepared a dwelling place. The first word of Scripture is not about God standing alone in transcendent majesty; it is about God creating a space for relationship, for intimacy, for communion. The entire narrative of the Bible—from the Garden of Eden to the Tabernacle in the wilderness, from Solomon’s Temple to the incarnation of Christ—is the story of God’s relentless pursuit to dwell with His people.</p><p>When John wrote that “the Word became flesh and dwelt among us” (John 1:14), the Greek word he used is <em>eskēnōsen</em>, which literally means “tabernacled” or “pitched His tent.” Jesus is the ultimate fulfillment of the Bet. He is the house of God among humanity. The story that begins with a house finds its culmination when God Himself takes up residence in human flesh.</p><p>But this is only the beginning. There are deeper layers still.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The Architecture of Seven: A Divine Blueprint</h2><p>Look closely at the structure of Genesis 1:1. In Hebrew, this verse contains exactly <strong>seven words</strong>. Not six. Not eight. Seven. The number of divine completion, of perfection, of rest. The very architecture of the verse points forward to the seventh day, when God rested from His work of creation.</p><p>But there is more. The total number of letters in this verse is <strong>28</strong>—which is 7 × 4. The first three words focus on God’s action: “In-beginning created God.” The last four words focus on God’s creation: “the-heavens and-the-earth.” This 3-4 pattern reflects the divine (the Trinity) acting upon the material (the four corners of the earth, the four winds, the four seasons).</p><p>Now comes the revelation that should make every reader pause: the middle word of the seven—the fourth word, the hinge upon which the entire sentence turns—is <strong>את (Aleph-Tav).</strong></p><p>This word is untranslated in virtually every English Bible. It is a grammatical marker, a pointer to the direct object of the verb. But it is composed of the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet. And in the book of Revelation, Jesus declares, “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End” (Revelation 1:8, 21:6, 22:13).</p><p>Do you see it? Jesus—the Aleph-Tav, the Alpha and Omega—is not on the margins of creation. He is not a footnote. He is the <strong>center</strong>. He is the hinge upon which heaven and earth meet, the mediator between Creator and creation. This is not coincidence. This is divine design.</p><p>Throughout the Old Testament, the Aleph-Tav appears over 7,000 times. Most English translations ignore it entirely because it has no direct grammatical equivalent. But in the Hebrew text, it stands as a silent witness, a divine signature, marking the places where God is at work. It appears in Genesis 1:1, pointing to the heavens and the earth. It appears when God makes covenants with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It appears in the giving of the Law at Sinai. It appears in the prophecies of the Messiah. Everywhere God acts, the Aleph-Tav is there—a hidden pointer to Jesus, the One through whom all things were made and for whom all things exist.</p><p>This is not coincidence. This is divine design. And it invites us to go deeper still.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The First Word: <em>Bereshit</em>—A Universe in Six Letters</h2><div id="youtube2-jkGRS1OAFCw" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;jkGRS1OAFCw&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jkGRS1OAFCw?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>The word <em>Bereshit</em> (בְּרֵאשִׁית) is typically translated “in the beginning.” But its root, <em>Rosh</em> (רֹאשׁ), means “head” or “source.” A more precise translation would be “in the source” or “in the headship.” Everything begins in God, not separate from Him. Creation is not an external act but an overflow of His being.</p><p>But the true wonder is hidden in the letters themselves. Modern languages use letters as sounds. Ancient Hebrew used letters as pictures, as symbols, as windows into deeper meaning. Each letter in <em>Bereshit</em> carries a pictographic meaning from the ancient script:</p><p>Hebrew LetterPictographPictographic Meaning<strong>Bet (ב)</strong>A House or TentHouse, Family, In, Within<strong>Resh (ר)</strong>Head of a ManHead, First, Top, Beginning<strong>Aleph (א)</strong>Head of an OxStrength, Power, Leader, God<strong>Shin (ש)</strong>Two Front TeethSharp, Press, Destroy, Consume<strong>Yod (י)</strong>An Arm and HandWork, Make, Deed, To Throw<strong>Tav (ת)</strong>Two Crossed SticksMark, Sign, Covenant, Cross</p><p>Hebrew is a language of layers. Words are built from smaller root words, and those roots carry meaning that compounds and deepens. When <em>Bereshit</em> is broken into its component parts, something extraordinary emerges:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bar (בַּר):</strong> The first two letters spell Bar, the Aramaic word for <strong>“Son.”</strong> This is the language Jesus spoke when He walked the earth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aleph (א):</strong> The third letter, standing alone, represents <strong>God.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Rosh (רֹאשׁ):</strong> The letters Resh, Aleph, and Shin form the word for <strong>“Head”</strong> or “First.” Paul would later write that Christ is “the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead” (Colossians 1:18).</p></li><li><p><strong>Brosh (בְּרוֹשׁ):</strong> The letters Bet, Resh, and Shin form the word for <strong>“Cypress Tree”</strong>—a tall, straight timber used in construction. This foreshadows the cross, the tree upon which Jesus would be lifted up.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shayit (שַׁיִת):</strong> The letters Shin, Yod, and Tav can mean <strong>“thorns.”</strong> The crown of thorns pressed into His skull.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shay (שַׁי):</strong> The letters Shin and Yod form the word for <strong>“gift.”</strong> Jesus is the gift of God to humanity (John 3:16).</p></li><li><p><strong>Tav (ת):</strong> The final letter, in its ancient form, was drawn as an <strong>X or a cross</strong>—the sign of the covenant.</p></li></ul><p>When these layers are assembled, the first word of Scripture seems to declare:</p><blockquote><p><strong>“The Son of God, the Head of all things, will be destroyed by thorns on a tree, a gift of the covenant.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>This is the Gospel, written in the opening word of Genesis. The cross was not an emergency plan. The Lamb was slain from the foundation of the world (Revelation 13:8). Before God spoke the first “Let there be,” the redemption of humanity was already etched into His heart—and into the first word of His revelation.</p><p>This is what theologians call the “eternal covenant of redemption.” Before time began, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit agreed upon a plan to rescue fallen humanity. The Son would become the sacrifice. The Father would send Him. The Spirit would empower Him. And all of this—every detail, every moment, every drop of blood—was planned before the first star ignited, before the first atom formed, before the first breath was drawn. The Gospel is not an afterthought. It is the forethought, the central theme, the reason for creation itself.</p><p>And yet, there is still more to discover.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The First Seven Letters: Christ in the Opening Sequence</h2><p>The first word, <em>Bereshit</em>, contains six letters. But what if we extend our gaze to the <strong>first seven letters</strong> of the entire Torah? The seventh letter is the Aleph (א) that begins the second word, <em>Bara</em> (בָּרָא), meaning “created.”</p><p>When read in sequence, the first seven letters of Genesis are: <strong>Bet-Resh-Aleph-Shin-Yod-Tav-Aleph (בראשיתא).</strong> These seven letters, when examined through their pictographic meanings, tell a complete story:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Bet (ב)</strong> - House</p></li><li><p><strong>Resh (ר)</strong> - Head/First</p></li><li><p><strong>Aleph (א)</strong> - God/Strength</p></li><li><p><strong>Shin (ש)</strong> - Consume/Destroy</p></li><li><p><strong>Yod (י)</strong> - Hand/Work</p></li><li><p><strong>Tav (ת)</strong> - Covenant/Cross</p></li><li><p><strong>Aleph (א)</strong> - God/Strength</p></li></ol><p>Read as a sentence, these seven letters proclaim: <strong>“The house of the First God will be consumed by the work of the covenant, revealing God.”</strong> Or more directly: <strong>“God will dwell in a house (incarnation), be destroyed by the work of the cross (crucifixion), and reveal God (resurrection).”</strong></p><p>Seven is the number of completion. The first seven letters of Scripture contain the complete Gospel narrative: incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. This is not coincidence. This is not human ingenuity. This is the fingerprint of the divine Author, who embedded the story of redemption into the very fabric of creation’s opening words.</p><p>This pattern of seven runs throughout Scripture. Seven days of creation. Seven feasts of Israel. Seven churches in Revelation. Seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls. The number seven speaks of God’s perfect work, His complete plan, His finished purpose. And here, in the first seven letters of the Bible, we see the complete work of salvation: God with us, God for us, God in us.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The Consuming Fire and the Shadow of the Fall</h2><p>The glory of God revealed in creation is both beautiful and terrifying. The author of Hebrews reminds us, “Our God is a consuming fire” (Hebrews 12:29). This is not merely a metaphor for anger; it is a statement about His fundamental nature. His holiness, His life, His purity are so absolute that sin cannot exist in His presence, any more than a shadow can exist in the heart of the sun. Fire consumes chaff by its very nature. God’s holiness consumes sin.</p><p>This presents a terrible problem. If God is a consuming fire, how can sinful humanity ever hope to approach Him? The story of Genesis is not just about the glory of creation, but also the tragedy of the Fall. When Adam and Eve chose their own will over God’s, they introduced sin into the world. They chose the shadow over the light. This act of rebellion did not just break a rule; it corrupted their very nature, turning them from beings who walked with God in the cool of the day into beings who hid from His presence in fear.</p><p>This is the depravity of the human heart: a bent toward self, a preference for darkness, a condition that makes us incompatible with the holy presence of God. Every subsequent act of violence, greed, and pride in Scripture flows from this original turning away. The glory of creation is immediately followed by the shadow of the Fall, setting the stage for the central drama of the Bible: How can a holy God dwell with a sinful people?</p><p>The problem is not merely behavioral. It is ontological. Sin is not just something we do; it is something we are. We are born into a fallen world, inheriting a nature that is bent away from God. The prophet Jeremiah declared, “The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?” (Jeremiah 17:9). This is not pessimism; it is realism. Apart from divine intervention, we are hopelessly lost, unable to save ourselves, unable to approach the consuming fire without being consumed.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The Language of New Creation: John 1:1</h2><p>When John opened his Gospel, he chose his words with surgical precision. He wrote for both Jewish and Greek audiences, and every term he selected would have resonated with profound meaning for both.</p><h3><em>En Archē</em> (Ἐν ἀρχῇ) — “In the beginning”</h3><p>For Jewish readers, <em>archē</em> is the direct Greek equivalent of the Hebrew <em>Bereshit</em>, immediately connecting John’s prologue to the creation account. For Greek audiences, <em>archē</em> was a central philosophical concept. The Presocratic philosophers used it to denote the first cause, the origin, or the ultimate underlying principle of all reality. By stating the Logos was “in the <em>archē</em>,” John asserts that Jesus is not a created being. He is the uncaused cause, the eternal source from which all reality originates.</p><h3><em>Ho Logos</em> (ὁ Λόγος) — “The Word”</h3><p>To the Jewish reader, the <em>Logos</em> was the <em>Davar Yahweh</em>—the creative, powerful Word of God. It was the Word that spoke light into existence (Genesis 1:3), that sustained the heavens (Psalm 33:6), and that accomplished God’s purposes (Isaiah 55:11). It was not just sound; it was power, action, divine will made manifest. In the Aramaic Targums (translations of the Hebrew Bible), the term <em>Memra</em> (the Word) was often used as a substitute for God’s name to describe God’s active presence in the world, a bridge between the transcendent God and the physical realm. When John calls Jesus the <em>Logos</em>, he is tapping into this rich Jewish understanding of God’s personal, creative, and redemptive agent.</p><p>To the Greek reader, the <em>Logos</em> was the eternal, rational principle that ordered the cosmos and kept it from descending into chaos. Philosophers like Heraclitus taught that the <em>Logos</em> was the divine reason behind all things, the mind behind the matter. The Stoics believed that living in harmony with the <em>Logos</em> was the highest good. John took both of these mighty concepts—the creative Word of God and the ordering principle of the universe—and made a revolutionary claim: <strong>this Logos is not a force. It is not an idea. It is a Person. It is Jesus Christ.</strong></p><div><hr></div><h2>The Scandal of Incarnation</h2><p>For both Jew and Greek, everything John had written so far was profound but not entirely shocking. But then came verse 14: <strong>“And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.”</strong></p><p>This is the answer to the problem of the consuming fire. The God who is incompatible with sin did not destroy us. He joined us. He became one of us.</p><p>To the Greek mind, this was absurd. The divine was pure spirit, eternal, unchanging. Matter was corrupt, temporary, inferior. The idea that the divine <em>Logos</em> could “become flesh” violated every philosophical principle they held. It was a category error of the highest order, like saying that a perfect circle could become a crooked line.</p><p>To the Jewish mind, this was blasphemy. God was utterly transcendent, dwelling in unapproachable light. He could reveal Himself through angels, prophets, or theophanies, but He could never become a finite, mortal human being. The Shema, the central prayer of Judaism, declares, “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4). To suggest that a man could be God was to shatter the very foundation of their faith.</p><p>Yet this is the very heart of the Gospel. The eternal, divine, creative Word—the mind of God, the power of God, the wisdom of God—put on skin and bone. Jesus pitched His tent (<em>eskēnōsen</em>) among humanity. The God who seemed so distant, so holy, so unapproachable, revealed Himself in a human face. He became the bridge, the mediator, the one who could stand in the fire on our behalf.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The Breath That Gives Life</h2><p>There is one more thread woven through these passages. In Genesis 1:2, it says, “the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.” The word for Spirit is <em>ruach</em> (רוּחַ). It means spirit, but it also means “breath” and “wind.” It is the invisible, dynamic energy of God in action.</p><p>It was the <em>ruach</em> of God that hovered over the primordial chaos, preparing it for the creative word. It was the <em>ruach</em> of God that the Father breathed into Adam’s nostrils, making him a living soul (Genesis 2:7). It was the <em>ruach</em> of God that Ezekiel called upon to bring dry bones to life (Ezekiel 37). And it was the <em>ruach</em> of God that descended upon Jesus at His baptism, anointing Him for ministry (Luke 3:22).</p><p>And after Jesus had conquered death and returned to His disciples, He stood among them and <strong>breathed</strong> on them. “Receive the Holy Spirit,” He said (John 20:22). And at Pentecost, that same Spirit came as a mighty, rushing wind (Acts 2:2).</p><p>The Word and the Breath are inseparable. Where Jesus speaks, the Spirit gives life. The same breath that hovered over the chaos of creation is the same breath that desires to fill the chaos of every human heart, to bring order, to bring light, to make all things new. This is the promise of the new creation: that the God who breathed life into Adam will breathe His Spirit into all who believe, transforming them from the inside out, making them new creatures in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17).</p><div><hr></div><h2>Going Deeper: The Invitation</h2><p>This is not the end. This is only the beginning. With Jesus, there is always another layer, another mystery, another depth waiting to be explored. The more one digs into Scripture, the more treasures emerge. The more one seeks, the more is found. The more one knocks, the more doors open.</p><p>The ancient rabbis had a saying: “Turn it and turn it, for everything is in it.” They were speaking of the Torah, but the principle applies to all of Scripture. Every verse, every word, every letter is pregnant with meaning. And at the center of it all is Jesus—the Word made flesh, the Aleph-Tav, the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End.</p><p><strong>This week, practice attentive silence.</strong> Each day, before speaking—even before praying—pause for one full minute. In that silence, acknowledge the truth uncovered here: <strong>God was there before your words.</strong> Listen beneath the noise of your own thoughts. You may just hear the echo of the Word who was in the beginning, the Word who holds all things together, and the Word who is, even now, speaking light into your darkness.</p><p>Consider also this: if the Gospel is encoded in the first word of Scripture, what other treasures lie hidden in the pages you have yet to explore? What mysteries await in the names, the numbers, the patterns, and the stories? The Bible is not a book to be read once and set aside. It is a lifetime’s pursuit, an inexhaustible well, a treasure chest that never runs empty. Every time you return to it, you will find something new, something deeper, something that speaks directly to where you are in your journey.</p><p><strong>The journey has only just begun. And there is always deeper to go.</strong></p><div><hr></div><h2>Further Resources</h2><div id="youtube2-PZ3hESj__M8" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;PZ3hESj__M8&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PZ3hESj__M8?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div id="youtube2-ixStG0IM268" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;ixStG0IM268&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ixStG0IM268?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div id="youtube2-Vt25awoelhk" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Vt25awoelhk&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vt25awoelhk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><h4><strong>Free Online Access</strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fenduringword.com%2F">Enduring Word (David Guzik)</a></strong>: Excellent, verse-by-verse pastoral commentary that is easy to read.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegospelcoalition.org%2Fcommentary%2F">The Gospel Coalition (TGC) Bible Commentary</a></strong>: Provides high-quality, free introductory commentaries by modern scholars like T.
