the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” - Genesis 1:1</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Verse:</strong> Genesis 1:1 - בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ<br>“In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” - Genesis 1:1</p><p><strong>Hebrew Focus:</strong> בְּרֵאשִׁית (Bereshit) - “In the beginning”</p><p>This is the very first word of the Hebrew Bible! Notice how Hebrew reads from right to left. The word breaks down as: בְּ (be - “in”) + רֵאשִׁית (reshit - “beginning”). The root רֹאשׁ (rosh) means “head” or “first,” so “reshit” means “the very first” or “the beginning.”</p><p><strong>Hebrew Letters Introduced:</strong> ב (Bet), ר (Resh), א (Aleph), ש (Shin), י (Yod), ת (Tav)</p><p><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>What does it mean that God existed before time itself began?</p><p><em><strong>Prayer:</strong> “God, You are the beginning of all things. Before time, before space, before anything existed, You were. Help me understand what it means to build my life on You as the foundation of everything.”</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Dr. Stephen Hawking was perhaps the most famous physicist of our time, known for his groundbreaking work on black holes and his book “A Brief History of Time.” Despite being diagnosed with ALS at age 21 and given only two years to live, he continued his research for over 50 years, revolutionizing our understanding of the universe. Throughout his career, Hawking grappled with the question of cosmic origins, writing, “If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason—for then we would know the mind of God.”</p><p>In 1981, Hawking attended a conference at the Vatican where Pope John Paul II told the assembled scientists they were free to study the evolution of the universe after the Big Bang, but should not inquire into the Big Bang itself because that was the moment of creation. Hawking later wrote: “I was glad then that he did not know the subject of the talk I had just given—the possibility that space-time was finite but had no boundary, which means that it had no beginning, no moment of creation.”</p><p>Yet even Hawking’s “no boundary” proposal couldn’t escape the fundamental question: Why does anything exist at all? In his final book, he wrote: “The question is: is the way the universe began chosen by God for reasons we can’t understand, or was it determined by a law of science? I believe the second. If you like, you can call the laws of science ‘God,’ but it wouldn’t be a personal God that you could meet, and ask questions.”</p><p>What’s remarkable is that Hawking, despite his atheism, couldn’t escape the language of creation and purpose. Even his scientific equations seemed to point toward what Genesis 1:1 declares: “In the beginning, God created.” The Hebrew word “bara” (בָּרָא) means to create something from nothing—exactly what modern cosmology suggests happened at the moment of the Big Bang.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Even the most brilliant scientific minds grapple with the question of ultimate origins. Genesis 1:1 provides the answer that science points toward but cannot prove: In the beginning, God created.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Theological and Historical Focus: <br>The Foundation of Everything</h4><p>Genesis 1:1 is not just the beginning of the Bible—it’s the foundation upon which all biblical truth rests. This single verse establishes several crucial truths that shape everything that follows.</p><h4>Bereshit - In the Beginning</h4><p>The Hebrew word “bereshit” (בְּרֵאשִׁית) is more than just a temporal marker. It establishes that time itself has a beginning. This was a revolutionary concept in the ancient world, where most cultures believed in cyclical time or eternal matter. The Hebrew Bible declares that time, like everything else, is created by God.</p><p>The word “reshit” (beginning) appears throughout Scripture to denote not just temporal priority but also supremacy and preeminence. In Proverbs 8:22, Wisdom says, “The Lord possessed me at the beginning (reshit) of his work.” In Jeremiah 2:3, Israel is called “the firstfruits (reshit) of his harvest.” The beginning is not just first in time—it’s first in importance.</p><h4>Bara - Created</h4><p>The Hebrew verb “bara” (בָּרָא) is used exclusively for divine activity in the Old Testament. Humans can make, form, or fashion things from existing materials, but only God can “bara”—create something from nothing. This word appears three times in Genesis 1 (verses 1, 21, and 27), marking the three great creative acts: the creation of matter and energy, the creation of conscious life, and the creation of humanity in God’s image.</p><p>The concept of creation ex nihilo (out of nothing) was unique in the ancient world. Other creation myths describe gods forming the world from pre-existing chaos or from the bodies of defeated enemies. But Genesis declares that God creates by the power of His word alone, bringing into existence what did not exist before.</p><h4>Elohim - God</h4><p>The Hebrew word “Elohim” (אֱלֹהִים) is grammatically plural but takes singular verbs when referring to the one true God. This has led many scholars to see hints of the Trinity even in the first verse of Scripture. The word comes from the root meaning “strength” or “power,” emphasizing God’s absolute authority and capability.</p><p>In the ancient Near East, “elohim” could refer to any divine beings, but in Genesis it refers specifically to the one Creator God who stands above and apart from His creation. This God is not part of the natural order—He is its source and sustainer.</p><h4>Et Hashamayim V’et Ha’aretz - The Heavens and the Earth</h4><p>The phrase “the heavens and the earth” (הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ) is a Hebrew idiom meaning “everything that exists.” It’s a merism—a figure of speech that expresses totality by naming the extremes. God didn’t just create some things; He created everything.</p><p>The word “shamayim” (heavens) is always plural in Hebrew, suggesting the multiple dimensions of heavenly reality—the atmospheric heavens, the stellar heavens, and the spiritual heavens where God dwells. The word “eretz” (earth) can mean the planet, dry land, or a specific territory, but here it represents all physical reality.</p><h4>The Connection to Christ</h4><p>John 1:1-3 deliberately echoes Genesis 1:1: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.”</p><p>The “Word” (Logos) who was in the beginning is identified as Jesus Christ in John 1:14. This means that Jesus, as the eternal Word, was the agent of creation. When Genesis says “God created,” it includes the work of the Son as the active agent of creation.</p><p>Colossians 1:16-17 makes this explicit: “For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together.”</p><h4>The Ecclesiastes Connection</h4><p>The concept of “beginning” in Genesis 1:1 stands in stark contrast to the cyclical futility described in Ecclesiastes. While Ecclesiastes 1:9 observes that “there is nothing new under the sun,” Genesis 1:1 declares that there was a moment when everything was new—when God spoke creation into existence.</p><p>This tension between the “newness” of creation and the “vanity” of fallen existence points us toward the hope of new creation in Christ. In 2 Corinthians 5:17, Paul declares, “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.”</p><h4>The Implications for Faith</h4><p>Genesis 1:1 addresses the fundamental questions that every human being asks: Where did I come from? Why do I exist? What is my purpose? The answer begins with understanding that we are not cosmic accidents but intentional creations of a purposeful God.</p><p>If God created everything, then everything belongs to Him. This establishes His right to rule over His creation and our responsibility to live according to His design. It also establishes the inherent value and meaning of existence—we live in a created order, not a random chaos.</p><h4>Why This Matters for Us</h4><p>Understanding Genesis 1:1 in Hebrew connects us to the very words that God used to reveal the origin of everything. When we read “Bereshit bara Elohim,” we’re not just learning ancient language—we’re encountering the foundational truth upon which our faith rests.</p><p>This verse also establishes the pattern for how God works: He speaks, and reality responds. The same God who said “Let there be light” can speak into the darkness of our lives.
