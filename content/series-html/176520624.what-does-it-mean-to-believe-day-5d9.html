you; he is the Messiah, the Lord.” - Luke 2:11</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Verse: </strong>John 20:28 - “Thomas said to him, ‘My Lord and my God!’”</p><p><strong>Greek Phrase: </strong>Ὁ κύριός μου καὶ ὁ θεός μου (Ho kyrios mou kai ho theos mou) - “My Lord and my God.” This is one of the clearest declarations of Jesus’s divinity in the New Testament, using the strongest possible language for divine identity.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>What would it have cost Thomas to make this declaration in a world where Caesar was called “Lord and God”?</p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“Help me understand the courage it took for the first believers to declare their allegiance to Jesus in a hostile world.”</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Sarah Chen’s article was due in two days, and she was paralyzed. She had spent six weeks investigating what she expected to be a medical fraud, but instead had uncovered what appeared to be a genuine breakthrough in cancer treatment. The evidence was overwhelming, the documentation was solid, and the results were independently verified. But publishing this story would change everything.</p><p>Her editor had already expressed skepticism about the direction of her investigation. “Sarah, you went there to debunk this thing, not to become their PR department,” he had said during their last phone call. Her colleagues in the medical journalism community would question her credibility. Some would assume she had been bought off or had lost her objectivity. Publishing a story that validated extraordinary medical claims would put her reputation on the line.</p><p>But the alternative was worse. She had met Maria Santos, a 34-year-old mother of three who had been given two months to live eighteen months ago. She had interviewed Dr. Williams, a Harvard-trained oncologist who had initially dismissed the treatment as “snake oil” but was now sending his own patients to Houston after seeing the results. She had examined lab reports, scanned medical records, and verified patient outcomes through independent sources.</p><p>Sarah realized that her dilemma wasn’t really about the evidence anymore—it was about what she was willing to risk to tell the truth. Publishing this story would align her with claims that seemed impossible, but the evidence demanded that someone with credibility speak up. The question was whether she was willing to stake her professional reputation on what she had discovered.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Sometimes believing the truth requires us to risk our reputation, relationships, and standing in our community—especially when that truth challenges prevailing assumptions.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Historical and Cultural Focus:<br>The Cost of Confession in the Roman World</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: John 20:24-31 (NIV)</strong><br><em>24 Now Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. 25 So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!”But he said to them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”26 A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” 27 Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.”28 Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”29 Then Jesus told him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”30 Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. 31 But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</em></p></blockquote><h4>The Political Context of “Lord and God”</h4><p>When Thomas declared Jesus to be “My Lord and my God,” he was using titles that carried enormous political weight in the Roman Empire. The emperor was officially called “Dominus et Deus” (Lord and God), and citizens were required to participate in emperor worship as a demonstration of loyalty to Rome.</p><p>For a Jew to apply these same titles to a crucified carpenter from Nazareth was not just religiously significant—it was politically subversive. It implied that ultimate authority belonged not to Caesar but to Jesus, and that true divinity resided not in the emperor but in the risen Christ.</p><p>John’s original readers would have understood immediately that Thomas’s confession was a declaration of competing allegiance. This wasn’t just a personal spiritual experience; it was a political statement that could have deadly consequences.</p><h4>The Religious Implications</h4><p>From a Jewish perspective, Thomas’s declaration was equally shocking. The Shema, the central confession of Jewish faith, declares: “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4). For a devout Jew to call another human being “God” would normally be considered blasphemy.</p><p>Yet Thomas, who had been with Jesus for three years and had heard his teaching about the Father, somehow understood that calling Jesus “God” didn’t contradict Jewish monotheism but fulfilled it. This suggests that Jesus’s own teaching and the experience of his resurrection had led Thomas to a radically new understanding of God’s nature.</p><h4>The Community Context</h4><p>John’s Gospel was likely written to a community that was facing persecution for their beliefs about Jesus. Many of the original readers would have been wrestling with the same question Thomas faced: Is Jesus really worth the cost of believing in him?</p><p>Thomas’s story would have been deeply encouraging to these early Christians. Here was someone who had demanded the highest level of proof, received it, and then made the ultimate confession of faith despite the personal and social costs. His example showed that rigorous investigation could lead to genuine faith, and that such faith was worth whatever it might cost.</p><h4>The Apologetic Purpose</h4><p>John explicitly states his purpose in writing: “These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name” (20:31). Thomas’s story serves this apologetic purpose in several ways:</p><p><em><strong>It Validates Honest Doubt:</strong> By including Thomas’s skepticism, John shows that faith doesn’t require the suppression of critical thinking. Even Jesus’s closest followers had questions and demanded evidence.</em></p><p><em><strong>It Provides Compelling Testimony: </strong>Thomas’s transformation from skeptic to believer is particularly powerful because of his initial resistance. His confession carries weight precisely because it was so hard-won.</em></p><p><em><strong>It Addresses Future Believers: </strong>Jesus’s blessing on those who “have not seen and yet have believed” speaks directly to John’s readers, who would need to make their decision based on testimony rather than direct experience.</em></p><h4>The Question of Martyrdom</h4><p>Church tradition holds that Thomas eventually traveled to India as a missionary and was martyred there for his faith. Whether or not this tradition is historically accurate, it illustrates the trajectory that began with his confession in John 20:28. Declaring Jesus to be “Lord and God” wasn’t just a theological statement—it was a life commitment that could lead to death.</p><p>John’s original readers would have understood this connection. Many of them were facing persecution, exile, or death for their beliefs. Thomas’s story reminded them that their faith was grounded in solid evidence and that the cost of discipleship had been faced by others before them.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>Thomas’s confession “My Lord and my God!” had political, religious, and social implications in the first century.
