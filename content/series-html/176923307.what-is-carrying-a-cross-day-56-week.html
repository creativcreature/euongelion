Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?” - Matthew 16:26</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Verse:</strong> Matthew 16:26 - “What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?”</p><p><strong>Greek Word:</strong> κερδαίνω (Kerdaino) - “To gain” or “to profit.” This is often used in commercial contexts—it’s the language of business transactions and cost-benefit analysis applied to the ultimate questions of life.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question:</strong> How do I calculate the true cost and benefit of following Jesus versus pursuing worldly success and security?<br><strong><br>Urgency Moment: </strong>Before this day ends, make one specific commitment that will cost you something but serve God’s kingdom. Write it down. Tell someone about it. Start tomorrow.</p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“Give me wisdom to see clearly what truly matters, and courage to make decisions based on eternal rather than temporary values.”</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Six months after Dr. Michael Rodriguez arrived in Guatemala, he received an email from a colleague at Metropolitan Hospital. Dr. James Chen had been offered the position at Johns Hopkins that Michael had turned down, and he was writing to thank Michael for the opportunity. “I have to admit, I thought you were crazy when you chose Guatemala over Hopkins,” Dr. Chen wrote. “But I wanted you to know that your decision changed my perspective on what success really means.”</p><p>Dr. Chen went on to describe how Michael’s choice had sparked conversations throughout the hospital about the purpose of medicine and the meaning of a successful career. Several doctors had begun volunteering at free clinics, others had changed their research focus to address diseases affecting the global poor, and the hospital had started a new program to train doctors for international service.</p><p>Meanwhile, Michael was discovering that his own life had been transformed in ways he hadn’t anticipated. The work was indeed challenging—he was performing complex surgeries with basic equipment, training local doctors with limited resources, and living far more simply than he ever had. But he had also experienced a sense of purpose and fulfillment that had been missing from his previous success.</p><p>The breakthrough moment had come three months earlier when he successfully performed a complex cardiac procedure on a seven-year-old girl named Sofia, whose family had traveled for days to reach the clinic. As Sofia recovered and returned to her village, Michael realized that this single surgery would allow her to live a full life, attend school, and contribute to her community in ways that would have been impossible without the intervention.</p><p>“I thought I was giving up my career to help people in Guatemala,” Michael wrote in his journal that night. “What I discovered was that I had found my true calling and learned what it means to practice medicine as a vocation rather than just a profession. The life I thought I was losing was actually the life I was finding.”</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Sometimes what we think we’re sacrificing turns out to be what was keeping us from discovering our true purpose and deepest fulfillment.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Personal Response:<br>Moving from Decision to Action</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: Matthew 16:24-28 (NIV)<br></strong><em>24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. 25 For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it. 26 What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?27 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done. 28 Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”</em></p></blockquote><h4>Counting the Cost</h4><p>Jesus’s question about gaining the world but forfeiting your soul isn’t rhetorical—it’s a call to serious cost-benefit analysis. Following Jesus requires honestly assessing what we might need to give up and what we stand to gain, both in this life and in eternity.</p><p><strong>The “cost” of discipleship might include:</strong><br><em>•Comfort and security that comes from pursuing conventional success<br>•Approval from others who don’t understand our choices<br>•Financial advantages that come from prioritizing profit over principle<br>•Time and energy that could be spent on personal pleasure or advancement<br>•Control over our own agenda and priorities</em></p><p><strong>The “benefit” of discipleship includes:<br></strong><em>•Alignment with our deepest purpose and calling<br>•Peace that comes from living with integrity<br>•Joy that comes from serving something greater than ourselves<br>•Community with others who share similar values and commitments<br>•Confidence about our eternal destiny and ultimate meaning</em></p><h4>Starting Where You Are</h4><p>Not everyone is called to make dramatic changes like Dr. Rodriguez’s move to Guatemala. Cross-bearing discipleship begins with honestly assessing where you are and taking the next faithful step, whatever that might be.</p><p>This might involve:</p><p><em><strong>Small Daily Choices:</strong> Looking for opportunities each day to choose service over self-interest, generosity over accumulation, truth over convenience, or love over indifference.</em></p><p><em><strong>Gradual Lifestyle Adjustments: </strong>Making incremental changes toward simpler living, more generous giving, or more intentional relationships, allowing these changes to build momentum over time.</em></p><p><em><strong>Specific Commitments: </strong>Identifying one or two areas where you sense God calling you to greater faithfulness and making concrete commitments to growth in those areas.</em></p><h4>Practical Steps for Cross-Bearing</h4><p><strong>Financial Discipleship:</strong><br><em>•Establish a giving plan that requires some sacrifice and trust<br>•Make consumer decisions based on kingdom values rather than just personal preference<br>•Consider career choices based on calling and contribution rather than just compensation<br>•Practice contentment with “enough” rather than always wanting more</em></p><p><strong>Relational Discipleship:</strong><br><em>•Prioritize relationships that matter most, even when this requires saying no to other opportunities<br>•Practice forgiveness and reconciliation, even when it’s difficult or costly<br>•Look for ways to serve others, particularly those who can’t repay you<br>•Engage in difficult conversations when truth and love require it</em></p><p><strong>Vocational Discipleship:</strong><br><em>•Approach your work as a calling to serve God and others, not just a way to earn money<br>•Look for ways to use your skills and resources for kingdom purposes<br>•Consider how your career contributes to human flourishing and God’s purposes in the world<br>•Be willing to make professional choices based on ethical considerations</em></p><p><strong>Community Discipleship:</strong><br><em>•Participate actively in Christian community for mutual encouragement and accountability<br>•Engage in service projects and social justice initiatives<br>•Share your resources with others in need<br>•Mentor others who are learning to follow Jesus</em></p><h4>Dealing with Fear and Resistance</h4><p>Most of us experience fear when we consider what cross-bearing discipleship might require of us. This is normal and doesn’t disqualify us from following Jesus. The key is to acknowledge our fears honestly while not allowing them to prevent us from taking faithful steps.</p><p><strong>Common fears include:</strong><br>•Financial insecurity if we’re more generous or make career choices based on calling rather than just income<br>•Social rejection if we live differently from cultural norms<br>•Missing out on opportunities if we prioritize kingdom values over personal advancement<br>•Being taken advantage of if we’re too generous or forgiving</p><p>These fears often reflect deeper questions about whether we can really trust God to provide for us and whether following Jesus will ultimately lead to blessing or deprivation.</p><h4>The Role of Community and Accountability</h4><p>Cross-bearing discipleship is difficult to sustain in isolation. We need relationships with others who share similar commitments and can encourage us when the cost feels overwhelming.</p><p><strong>This might involve:</strong><br>•Finding or creating a small group focused on discipleship and spiritual growth<br>•Identifying a mentor who models the kind of life you want to live<br>•Participating in service projects with other Christians<br>•Being part of a church community that takes discipleship seriously</p><h4>Growing into Greater Faithfulness</h4><p>Cross-bearing discipleship is a lifelong journey rather than a one-time decision. We grow into greater faithfulness gradually, as we learn to trust God more deeply and experience the joy that comes from living according to his purposes.</p><p><strong>This process involves:</strong><br>•Regular self-examination and confession when we fall short<br>•Celebrating progress and growth, even when it’s incremental<br>•Learning from failures and setbacks rather than being paralyzed by them<br>•Continually asking God to show us the next step in following Jesus more faithfully</p><h4>The Promise of Finding Life</h4><p>Jesus’s promise that those who lose their life for his sake will find it isn’t just about the afterlife—it’s about discovering authentic life in the present. Many people who have made significant sacrifices to follow Jesus report that they’ve found greater fulfillment, purpose, and joy than they experienced when they were living primarily for themselves.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that cross-bearing discipleship is always easy or pleasant, but it does mean that it leads to the kind of life that is ultimately satisfying and meaningful.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>What specific areas of your life do you sense God calling you to greater faithfulness and sacrifice? What would it look like to take the next step in those areas?</p></li><li><p>What fears or concerns do you have about following Jesus more radically? How might you address those fears while still moving forward in faith?</p></li><li><p>What practical commitments are you willing to make this week to begin living more as a cross-bearing disciple?</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h3>Share Your Thoughts</h3><p>What practical steps are you considering as a result of this week’s study of Jesus’s call to discipleship? What aspects of taking up your cross feel most challenging or exciting? Share your commitments and encourage others in their journey of following Jesus.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Greek Language Learning: Week 2, Day 5</h2><h4>Infinitives and Purpose Clauses</h4><p>Today we’re learning about Greek infinitives—verbal nouns that express purpose, result, or indirect commands. Jesus often uses infinitives to explain why he calls us to discipleship.</p><h4>Infinitive Forms</h4><p><strong>Infinitives are the “to” form of verbs:</strong><br>ἀκολουθεῖν (akolouthein) - “to follow” <br>πιστεύειν (pisteuein) - “to believe” <br>σῴζειν (sozein) - “to save” <br>ἀπολλύναι (apollynai) - “to lose” or “to destroy”</p><h4>Infinitive Endings</h4><p><strong>Present Active:</strong> -ειν (ein) <br><strong>Present Middle/Passive:</strong> -εσθαι (esthai) <br><strong>Aorist Active: </strong>-σαι (sai) <br><strong>Aorist Middle: </strong>-σασθαι (sasthai)</p><h4>Purpose Clauses with Infinitives</h4><p>ἦλθον καλέσαι (elthon kalesai) “I came to call” or “I came in order to call”<br>θέλει σῶσαι (thelei sosai) “he wants to save”</p><h4>Jesus’s Teaching with Infinitives</h4><p>ὃς γὰρ ἐὰν θέλῃ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ σῶσαι ἀπολέσει αὐτήν <br>(hos gar ean thele ten psychen autou sosai apolesei auten) <br>“For whoever wants to save his life will lose it”</p><p><strong>Breaking down the infinitive:</strong><br>•σῶσαι (sosai) - “to save” (aorist active infinitive)</p><h4>Common Infinitive Constructions</h4><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> “in order to...” ἦλθεν σῶσαι = “he came to save”</p><p><strong>Indirect Command: </strong>“to do something” κελεύει ἀκολουθεῖν = “he commands (them) to follow”</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> “so as to...” ὥστε σῴζειν = “so as to save”</p><h4>Key Infinitive Vocabulary</h4><p>σῴζω (sozo) - “I save” <br>σῶσαι (sosai) - “to save” <br>ἀπόλλυμι (apollymi) - “I destroy/lose” <br>ἀπολέσαι (apolesai) - “to lose/destroy” <br>εὑρίσκω (heurisko) - “I find” <br>εὑρεῖν (heurein) - “to find”</p><h4>Reading Practice</h4><p>τί ὠφελεῖται ἄνθρωπος ἐὰν κερδήσῃ τὸν κόσμον ὅλον <br>(ti opheletai anthropos ean kerdese ton kosmon holon) <br>“What does it profit a person if he gains the whole world”</p><h4>Memory Tip</h4><p>Infinitives often end in -ειν (like our “to” + verb). Think “Ein” = “In order to”!</p><h4>Practice Exercise</h4><p><strong>Identify the infinitives:</strong></p><ol><li><p>ἀκολουθεῖν = ?</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p>πιστεύειν = ?</p></li></ol><ol start="3"><li><p>σῶσαι = ?</p></li></ol><p><em>Answers: 1. to follow, 2. to believe, 3. to save</em></p><p>Tomorrow we’ll put everything together and read Jesus’s complete call to discipleship in Greek!</p><div><hr></div><h3>Coming Tomorrow...</h3><p>Our final day will focus on practical integration. How do we live as people who have accepted Jesus’s call to take up our cross? What does cross-bearing discipleship look like in the daily rhythms of life? We’ll also see the long-term impact of Dr. Rodriguez’s decision.</p><p><em><strong>Don’t miss Day 6: </strong>Put It to Use - living as cross-bearing disciples.</em></p><div><hr></div><p><em>This is Day 5 of our 6-day series “What is Carrying a Cross?” [<a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/what-is-carrying-a-cross-day-16-week?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">Day 1</a>] | [<a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/what-is-carrying-a-cross-day-26-week?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">Day 2</a>] | [<a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/why-jesus-day-16-week-18?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">Day 3</a>] | [<a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/why-jesus-day-46-week-18?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">Day 4</a>] | [Day 5] | Coming Tomorrow: Day 6 - Put It to Use</em></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 6: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
