Conversion</strong>”.</em></p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Week 3 Master Document</strong></h2><h1><strong>From Jerusalem to the Nations: Servants, Suffering, and a Surprising Conversion </strong><em>(Acts 6–9)</em></h1><p>Week 3 is the turning point of the entire book of Acts.</p><p>Week 1 showed us the foundation of the early church.<br>Week 2 showed us what happens when the Spirit-filled church steps into public life.<br>Now Week 3 shows us how God grows His church through <strong>service</strong>, <strong>suffering</strong>, and <strong>surprise</strong>.</p><p>Acts 6–9 is not a quiet chapter in church history. It is bursting with movement, tension, courage, tragedy, and redemption. The gospel begins to break out of its original boundaries. Leadership expands. Persecution erupts. A martyr dies with a vision of Jesus. A persecutor meets Jesus in glory. The church is scattered — and through that scattering, the mission of God accelerates.</p><p>This week asks:<br><strong>What if God uses our service, our suffering, and even our enemies to advance His mission?</strong></p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Key Passage: Acts 7:54–60 (NIV)</strong></h1><p><em>Stephen’s Martyrdom – The Hinge of Acts 6–9</em></p><blockquote><p><strong>54</strong> When the members of the Sanhedrin heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him.<br><strong>55</strong> But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.<br><strong>56</strong> “Look,” he said, “I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.”<br><strong>57</strong> At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him,<br><strong>58</strong> dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.<br><strong>59</strong> While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”<br><strong>60</strong> Then he fell on his knees and cried out, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” When he had said this, he fell asleep.<br>— <em>Bible Gateway</em></p></blockquote><p>Stephen becomes the first Christian to die for his witness — and the way he dies becomes the seed of a global movement.</p><p>This moment stands at the center of Acts 6–9.<br>It is the place where:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Suffering births mission.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Violence meets grace.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>A persecutor sees true faith for the first time.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>A dying man resembles his Savior.</strong></p></li></ul><p>The result?<br>The gospel begins to spread beyond Jerusalem for the first time.</p><p>For a visual overview of this section, watch:<br><strong>BibleProject: Acts 8–12 Overview</strong><br></p><div id="youtube2-3E-aQAEEdPI" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;3E-aQAEEdPI&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3E-aQAEEdPI?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Setting the Stage: What Happens in Acts 6–9</strong></h1><p>Below is not just a summary — each movement is expanded so the reader understands not only <em>what</em> happened, but <em>why it mattered</em>.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>1. A Crisis of Care and the Birth of Deacons (Acts 6:1–7)</strong></h2><p>As the church grows, a complaint emerges: Greek-speaking widows feel neglected in the daily food distribution.<br>This is not a small issue — it threatens unity along ethnic and cultural lines.</p><p>The apostles respond with clarity and wisdom:</p><h3><strong>a. They refuse to neglect their calling.</strong></h3><p>The apostles say plainly that they cannot forsake “the ministry of the word and prayer.”<br>They understand their primary role — guiding the community spiritually — and they refuse to compromise it.</p><h3><strong>b. They elevate service to a Spirit-filled calling.</strong></h3><p>Instead of treating food distribution as “beneath them,” they insist the church choose <strong>seven men full of the Spirit and wisdom</strong>.</p><p>This teaches us a crucial truth:<br><strong>Practical ministry requires spiritual maturity.</strong><br>Serving tables is holy work when it is done in the name and power of the Spirit.</p><h3><strong>c. They diversify leadership.</strong></h3><p>All seven appointed leaders have Greek names — meaning the marginalized group now has empowered leadership.<br>The Spirit solves internal tension not by suppressing differences, but by redeeming them.</p><h3><strong>d. The result is explosive growth.</strong></h3><p>“When the Word and the care both flourish, so does the church.”</p><p>This is the first moment we see:</p><ul><li><p>Organizational structure</p></li><li><p>Delegation</p></li><li><p>Shared leadership</p></li></ul><p>It models how the church must grow — deeper and wider at the same time.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>2. Stephen’s Ministry and Martyrdom (Acts 6:8–7:60)</strong></h2><p>Stephen is not an apostle.<br>He is not on a stage.<br>He is not a priest or a trained scholar.</p><p>He is a servant — and yet Acts describes him as:</p><ul><li><p><strong>full of faith</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>full of grace</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>full of power</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>full of the Holy Spirit</strong></p></li></ul><p>He performs signs and wonders.<br>He speaks with wisdom that no one can refute.<br>He becomes a living example that the Spirit can empower anyone, not just the original Twelve.</p><h3><strong>Stephen’s Speech (Acts 7)</strong></h3><p>Stephen retells Israel’s entire history — but this is not mere storytelling.<br>He is making a point:</p><p><strong>God’s people have always resisted God’s messengers.</strong><br>Abraham. Joseph. Moses. The prophets.<br>And now Jesus.</p><p>His speech is a theological masterpiece.<br>It reframes Israel’s story around Jesus as the climax of God’s plan.</p><h3><strong>His Vision</strong></h3><p>As the council condemns him, Stephen sees:</p><ul><li><p>heaven open</p></li><li><p>the glory of God</p></li><li><p>Jesus <strong>standing</strong> at the right hand of God</p></li></ul><p>In Scripture, Jesus is usually seated — His work complete.<br>Here, He stands.</p><p>It is the posture of an advocate, a witness, an honor-bearer.</p><p>Stephen dies with his eyes fixed on Christ — and his final words echo Christ’s own:</p><p>“Lord, receive my spirit.”<br>“Do not hold this sin against them.”</p><p>His death becomes the spark that lights the global mission.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>3. Scattering and Expansion (Acts 8:1–25)</strong></h2><p>Stephen’s death unleashes a wave of persecution led by Saul.</p><p>Instead of crushing the movement, the persecution <strong>scatters the believers</strong> into Judea and Samaria — exactly as Jesus foretold in Acts 1:8.</p><p>Where they go, the gospel goes.</p><h3><strong>Philip in Samaria</strong></h3><p>Philip, another of the seven chosen servants, preaches in Samaria:</p><ul><li><p>Miracles break out</p></li><li><p>Demons flee</p></li><li><p>Many believe</p></li><li><p>A whole city experiences joy</p></li></ul><p>The gospel crosses ethnic hostility and enters a community long estranged from Jerusalem.</p><h3><strong>Simon the Sorcerer</strong></h3><p>This episode exposes the difference between:</p><ul><li><p>fascination with power</p></li><li><p>and surrender to Christ</p></li></ul><p>Simon wants influence, reputation, and control.<br>Peter rebukes him sharply — integrity matters just as much as zeal.</p><p>Samaria becomes the first major mission field.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>4. The Ethiopian Eunuch (Acts 8:26–40)</strong></h2><p>The Spirit sends Philip from a thriving city ministry to a desert road.</p><p>There he meets an Ethiopian official reading Isaiah 53 — the prophecy of the suffering servant.</p><p>This man is:</p><ul><li><p>a Gentile</p></li><li><p>a eunuch (excluded from full Temple access)</p></li><li><p>a royal treasurer</p></li><li><p>a seeker of God</p></li><li><p>returning to Africa</p></li></ul><p>Philip explains the gospel “beginning with that very passage.”<br>The official believes, is baptized, and carries the faith back to his homeland.</p><p>This is the first documented African Christian convert in Scripture.</p><p>The gospel is no longer Jewish-only.<br>It is becoming a <strong>global</strong> movement.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>5. Saul’s Conversion (Acts 9:1–31)</strong></h2><p>Saul is not just hostile to Christians.<br>He is their fiercest opponent — intelligent, zealous, influential, feared.</p><p>He is “breathing out murderous threats.”<br>He has legal authority to arrest believers.<br>He believes he is defending Israel.</p><p>Then Jesus interrupts his mission with a blinding light and a piercing question:</p><p><strong>“Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?”</strong></p><p>Jesus identifies Himself with His people — to harm them is to harm Him.</p><p>Saul is blinded, humbled, disarmed.<br>Ananias, a simple disciple, prays for him and calls him “brother.”</p><p>Saul rises baptized, filled with the Spirit, and preaching Christ.</p><p>This is not just a conversion story.<br>It is a cosmic reversal — an enemy becomes a chosen instrument.</p><p>The church, scattered and wounded, begins to heal and grow stronger.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Historical &amp; Cultural Context (Expanded)</strong></h1><h2><strong>Hellenist vs. Hebraic Jews</strong></h2><p>The early church included:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hebraic Jews</strong> – native Aramaic-speaking Jews steeped in Judean culture</p></li><li><p><strong>Hellenistic Jews</strong> – Greek-speaking Jews shaped by broader Mediterranean culture</p></li></ul><p>These groups had different languages, customs, and traditions — and tension was inevitable.</p><p>Acts 6 shows the Spirit building a multicultural church without erasing diversity.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Why Stephen’s Speech Enraged the Sanhedrin</strong></h2><p>Stephen challenged:</p><ul><li><p>their stewardship of the Temple</p></li><li><p>their reading of Scripture</p></li><li><p>their resistance to God’s messengers</p></li><li><p>their role in rejecting the Righteous One</p></li></ul><p>He reinterpreted Israel’s story around Jesus — a move that threatened the entire religious system.</p><p>They reacted not just emotionally but institutionally.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>The Significance of Samaria</strong></h2><p>Jews and Samaritans shared ancestry but deep hostility.<br>They worshiped on different mountains.<br>They accused each other of corruption.</p><p>When the Spirit moves in Samaria, He is healing centuries-old division.</p><p>This is a preview of the global reconciliation the gospel brings.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Ethiopia’s Power in Antiquity</strong></h2><p>The Ethiopian eunuch served Kandake, queen of the Nubian kingdom — a wealthy and powerful African empire.</p><p>His conversion is not random — it is the gospel entering a global trade network.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Why Saul’s Conversion Was Politically Explosive</strong></h2><p>Saul trained under Gamaliel.<br>He was rising fast in the Pharisaic movement.<br>His zeal represented the future of conservative Jewish leadership.</p><p>His conversion sent shockwaves throughout Judaism.</p><p>To lose Saul was to lose a future leader.<br>To embrace Jesus was to embrace the very movement he tried to destroy.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Key Theological Themes (Expanded)</strong></h1><h2><strong>1. God Uses Both Service and Suffering</strong></h2><p>Stephen and Philip show us two sides of Spirit-filled ministry:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Service</strong> meets practical needs with sacred purpose.</p></li><li><p><strong>Suffering</strong> becomes a megaphone of God’s glory.</p></li></ul><p>God grows the church through <strong>deacons and martyrs</strong>, administrators and evangelists.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>2. Jesus Continues His Work Through His People</strong></h2><p>The book is called ACTS for a reason — it records the <strong>acts of the risen Jesus</strong> through the Holy Spirit.</p><ul><li><p>Jesus heals through Peter.</p></li><li><p>Jesus reveals Himself to Stephen.</p></li><li><p>Jesus confronts Saul.</p></li><li><p>Jesus guides Philip.</p></li><li><p>Jesus comforts the scattered church.</p></li></ul><p>Jesus is alive, active, and involved.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>3. Persecution Pushes the Gospel Forward</strong></h2><p>Persecution does not stop the church.<br>It clarifies it.<br>Purifies it.<br>And multiplies it.</p><p>The church does not scatter in fear but in mission.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>4. The Gospel Is for Every People</strong></h2><p>Acts 6–9 touches:</p><ul><li><p>Hellenists</p></li><li><p>Hebraic Jews</p></li><li><p>Samaritans</p></li><li><p>Africans</p></li><li><p>Pharisees</p></li><li><p>Roman-linked officials</p></li></ul><p>The Spirit is forming a church that looks like the nations of the world.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>5. No One Is Beyond the Reach of Grace</strong></h2><p>Saul’s conversion becomes the template for hope:</p><p>If God can transform Saul, He can transform anyone — including the people we’ve written off.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Linguistic Deep Dive </strong></h1><h3>διάκονος (diakonos)</h3><p>A servant entrusted with sacred responsibility.<br>This word becomes the root of “deacon” — someone who reflects Jesus, who came “not to be served, but to serve.”</p><h3>μάρτυς (martys)</h3><p>Originally meant “witness.”<br>By Stephen’s death, it becomes synonymous with “one who bears witness through suffering.”</p><h3>διώκω (diōkō)</h3><p>Means “to pursue, chase down, harass.”<br>Paul uses this same verb to later describe his pursuit of Christ — a transformation from violent pursuit to holy pursuit.</p><h3>ἐκκλησία (ekklesia)</h3><p>Means “called-out assembly.”<br>In Acts 8–9 it refers to a community no longer defined by geography but by mission.</p><h3>μετανοέω (metanoeō)</h3><p>“Repentance: is not just moral sorrow — it is a total change of allegiance, direction, and vision.<br>Saul embodies this radically.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>What It Meant for Them (Expanded)</strong></h1><h3><strong>1. Leadership had to grow if the mission was going to grow.</strong></h3><p>The Spirit expands leadership beyond the apostles — a pattern still needed today.</p><h3><strong>2. Suffering was normal, not exceptional.</strong></h3><p>The early church did not interpret persecution as failure, but as participation in Jesus’ own path.</p><h3><strong>3. Unity required representation, not uniformity.</strong></h3><p>The appointment of Hellenistic leaders modeled true cross-cultural reconciliation.</p><h3><strong>4. Mission was no longer tied to one city.</strong></h3><p>Jerusalem was the birthplace — but not the boundary — of the gospel.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>What It Means for Us (Expanded)</strong></h1><h3><strong>1. Serving is spiritual.</strong></h3><p>When we meet needs, we join Stephen and Philip in Spirit-filled ministry.</p><h3><strong>2. Suffering may be the place where God shapes you most deeply.</strong></h3><p>God transforms the church through adversity — not around it.</p><h3><strong>3. The Spirit invites us beyond what is familiar.</strong></h3><p>Your Samaria might be a neighbor, a coworker, or a cultural barrier you have avoided.</p><h3><strong>4. The people you fear or dislike might become trophies of grace.</strong></h3><p>Never underestimate the reach of Jesus.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Cross Fitness Challenge (Week 3)</strong></h1><p><strong>Serving, Suffering, and Surprise</strong></p><h3><strong>Day 1 – Serve one person in a hidden, practical way.</strong></h3><p>Let service be worship.</p><h3><strong>Day 2 – Stay faithful in one difficult area.</strong></h3><p>Ask: “What obedience am I avoiding?”</p><h3><strong>Day 3 – Release one comfort that is limiting your courage.</strong></h3><p>Fear shrinks the mission. Surrender expands it.</p><h3><strong>Day 4 – Look for where God is stretching your mission field.</strong></h3><p>New people. New places. New opportunities.</p><h3><strong>Day 5 – Pray for someone far from God.</strong></h3><p>Remember Saul. No one is impossible.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Weekly Wrap-Up: The Story Turns Outward</strong></h1><p>Acts 6–9 is the hinge of the whole movement.<br>Through servants, through suffering, and through surprising grace, the gospel moves from:</p><p><strong>Jerusalem → Judea → Samaria → toward the ends of the earth.</strong></p><p>The story will only accelerate from here.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Week 4 Preview: Acts 10–12</strong></h2><p>Peter, Cornelius, a Roman household, a prison escape, and the gospel crossing ethnic boundaries for good.</p><p>If you want the daily devotions delivered automatically, subscribe so that <strong>Day 1 of Week 3</strong> lands in your inbox tomorrow.</p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 1: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
