For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.” - Romans 7:15</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Verse: </strong>Romans 7:15 - “I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.”</p><p><strong>Greek Word: </strong>συνίημι (Syniemi) - “To understand” or “to put together.” Paul is saying he can’t make sense of his own behavior—he can’t put together why he acts contrary to his own desires and values.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>How does Paul’s honest confession about his internal struggle encourage me in my own battles with repeated sin?</p><p><strong>Urgency Moment: </strong>Stop pretending you don’t struggle with repeated sin. Acknowledge one specific area where you keep failing, and recognize that this struggle doesn’t disqualify you from God’s love.</p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“Help me be honest about my struggles while trusting in your grace to transform me over time.”</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Marcus Thompson had been a Christian for twelve years, a deacon in his church for five, and had led countless Bible studies on victory over sin. But as he sat in his car outside the casino at 2 AM, he felt like the biggest hypocrite in the world. This was the fourth time in six months that he had driven here, telling himself he was just going to “look around” or “have dinner,” only to end up at the blackjack tables until the early morning hours.</p><p>The pattern was always the same: stress from work or family would build up, he would feel overwhelmed and out of control, and gambling provided a temporary escape where the only thing that mattered was the next card. For a few hours, he could forget about his responsibilities, his failures, and his disappointments. But the temporary relief always gave way to crushing shame, especially when he had to explain to his wife where he had been and why their savings account was smaller.</p><p>“God, I don’t understand myself,” Marcus prayed as he sat in the parking lot, the neon lights reflecting off his windshield. “I hate what gambling does to me, to my family, to my witness. I’ve prayed about this, I’ve confessed it, I’ve promised you and my wife that I would stop. But here I am again. What’s wrong with me? If I were really saved, wouldn’t I be able to overcome this?”</p><p>Marcus had grown up in a church that taught that real Christians don’t struggle with persistent sin—that genuine conversion leads to immediate and complete victory over sinful patterns. When he continued to struggle with gambling after becoming a Christian, he began to question whether his faith was real. Maybe he had never truly been saved. Maybe his prayers were just words. Maybe God had given up on him.</p><p>But as Marcus sat in his car, wrestling with shame and confusion, he remembered a conversation he had with his pastor the previous month. Pastor Williams had shared his own struggles with anger and how, even after decades of ministry, he still had to daily surrender his temper to God’s control. “Marcus,” he had said, “the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian isn’t that Christians don’t sin. It’s that Christians are bothered by their sin and keep coming back to God for forgiveness and help.”</p><p>As Marcus reflected on his pastor’s words, he realized that his very anguish over his gambling was actually evidence of God’s work in his life. A year ago, he had felt no guilt about his gambling—it was just entertainment. Now, he couldn’t even walk into the casino without feeling convicted. His conscience was more sensitive, not less. His desire for righteousness was stronger, even if his ability to achieve it was still imperfect.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The struggle against repeated sin, including the guilt and frustration it produces, is often evidence of God’s work in our lives rather than proof of his absence.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Textual and Theological Focus:<br>Paul’s Honest Confession About Internal Conflict</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: Romans 7:14-25 (NIV)<br></strong><em>14 We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 15 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. 16 And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. 17 As it is now, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me. 18 For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19 For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. 20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me.21 So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 22 For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; 23 but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work in my members. 24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? 25 Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.</em></p></blockquote><h4>The Debate Over Romans 7</h4><p>This passage has generated significant theological debate throughout church history. The central question is whether Paul is describing his experience as a non-Christian (before conversion) or as a Christian (after conversion). The evidence suggests he’s describing the ongoing Christian experience:</p><p><em><strong>Present Tense Verbs:</strong> Paul uses present tense throughout (”I do,” “I want,” “I hate”), suggesting current rather than past experience.</em></p><p><em><strong>Delight in God’s Law:</strong> Paul says he “delights in God’s law” in his “inner being” (v. 22), which describes the regenerate heart rather than the unregenerate mind.</em></p><p><em><strong>The Struggle Itself:</strong> The very existence of internal conflict between wanting to do good and failing to do it suggests the presence of a new nature that desires righteousness—something absent in the unregenerate person.</em></p><h4>The Nature of Internal Conflict</h4><p><strong>Paul describes a war taking place within himself between two competing forces:</strong></p><p><em><strong>The Law of the Mind: </strong>This represents the renewed mind that loves God’s law and desires to obey it. This is the new nature created by the Holy Spirit in regeneration.</em></p><p><em><strong>The Law of Sin: </strong>This represents the remaining influence of sin in the believer’s life—what theologians call “indwelling sin” or “the flesh.” This is not the believer’s true identity but a remaining corruption that continues to exert influence.</em></p><p>The conflict Paul describes is not between two equal forces but between the believer’s true identity (which delights in God’s law) and the remaining corruption that wars against it.</p><h4>The Frustration of Repeated Failure</h4><p>Paul’s language is remarkably emotional and personal. He doesn’t present a detached theological analysis but a raw confession of frustration and bewilderment. Several aspects of his description resonate with anyone who has struggled with repeated sin:</p><p><em><strong>Lack of Understanding:</strong> “I do not understand what I do” (v. 15). Paul can’t make sense of his own behavior—why he acts contrary to his own values and desires.</em></p><p><em><strong>Involuntary Action: </strong>“It is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me” (vv. 17, 20). Paul isn’t making excuses but recognizing that his sinful actions don’t represent his true will or identity.</em></p><p><em><strong>Persistent Pattern: </strong>“This I keep on doing” (v. 19). Paul acknowledges that this isn’t a one-time failure but an ongoing pattern of struggle.</em></p><p><em><strong>Deep Anguish: </strong>“What a wretched man I am!” (v. 24). The struggle produces genuine distress and a cry for deliverance.</em></p><h4>The Distinction Between Identity and Behavior</h4><p>A crucial aspect of Paul’s teaching is the distinction he makes between his true identity and his sinful behavior. He says “it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me” (v. 17). This isn’t an attempt to avoid responsibility but a recognition that sinful actions don’t define the believer’s true identity.</p><p><strong>This distinction is crucial for understanding how Christians should view their ongoing struggles with sin:</strong></p><p><em><strong>Sin is Real: </strong>Paul doesn’t minimize or excuse his sinful behavior. He acknowledges it as genuine failure to live up to God’s standards.</em></p><p><em><strong>Sin is Not Identity: </strong>However, Paul recognizes that his sinful actions don’t represent his true self—the person he is in Christ.</em></p><p><em><strong>Sin is Remaining, Not Reigning: </strong>Sin continues to influence the believer but it doesn’t rule over them. The believer’s fundamental orientation is toward God, even when their behavior is inconsistent.</em></p><h4>Old Testament Connection</h4><p>Paul’s struggle echoes the experience of many Old Testament saints who wrestled with their own failures and inconsistencies. King David, described as “a man after God’s own heart,” repeatedly fell into serious sin yet continued to be characterized by his fundamental love for God and his pattern of repentance.</p><p>In Psalm 51, written after David’s adultery with Bathsheba and murder of Uriah, David doesn’t question his salvation but cries out for cleansing and restoration: “Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me” (Psalm 51:10). Like Paul, David recognizes that his sinful actions don’t negate his relationship with God but create a need for ongoing cleansing and renewal.</p><p>The prophet Jeremiah also struggled with the deceitfulness of the human heart: “The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?” (Jeremiah 17:9). This Old Testament recognition of the ongoing corruption in human nature provides the backdrop for Paul’s New Testament analysis of the believer’s internal conflict.</p><h4>The Role of the Law</h4><p>Paul’s discussion of his struggle with sin comes in the context of explaining the role of God’s law in the believer’s life. The law serves several purposes in relation to ongoing sin:</p><p><em><strong>Revelation:</strong> The law reveals what God requires and exposes our failure to meet his standards.</em></p><p><em><strong>Conviction: </strong>The law creates awareness of sin and produces the kind of internal conflict Paul describes.</em></p><p><em><strong>Frustration: </strong>The law shows us what we should do but provides no power to do it, leading to the frustration Paul expresses.</em></p><p><em><strong>Preparation: </strong>The law prepares us to appreciate the gospel by showing us our need for a Savior.</em></p><h4>The Cry for Deliverance</h4><p>Paul’s anguished question—”Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?”—represents the cry of every believer who has struggled with repeated failure. The question acknowledges several important truths:</p><p><em><strong>Recognition of Need: </strong>Paul recognizes that he cannot deliver himself from his struggle with sin.</em></p><p><em><strong>Hope for Rescue: </strong>Despite his frustration, Paul believes that rescue is possible.</em></p><p><em><strong>External Source: </strong>The deliverance Paul seeks must come from outside himself.</em></p><p><em><strong>Ultimate Solution:</strong> The “body that is subject to death” points to the ultimate solution—the resurrection, when believers will be completely freed from the influence of sin.</em></p><h4>The Answer: Jesus Christ</h4><p><em><strong>Paul’s cry for deliverance is immediately answered: </strong>“Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (v. 25). This deliverance operates on multiple levels:</em></p><p><em><strong>Positional: </strong>Believers are already delivered from sin’s penalty and condemnation through Christ’s work.</em></p><p><em><strong>Progressive: </strong>Believers are being delivered from sin’s power through the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit.</em></p><p><em><strong>Ultimate: </strong>Believers will be completely delivered from sin’s presence at the </em>resurrection.</p><h4>The Ongoing Reality</h4><p>Paul concludes by acknowledging the ongoing nature of the struggle: “So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin” (v. 25). This isn’t defeat but realism—the recognition that the struggle with sin continues throughout the Christian life.</p><p><strong>This ongoing reality has important implications:</strong></p><p><em><strong>Normal Experience: </strong>Struggling with repeated sin is part of the normal Christian experience, not evidence of false faith.</em></p><p><em><strong>Continued Dependence:</strong> Believers need ongoing dependence on God’s grace rather than expecting to achieve sinless perfection in this life.</em></p><p><em><strong>Hope for Growth: </strong>While perfection isn’t achievable in this life, genuine growth and progress are possible through God’s power.</em></p><p><em><strong>Community Support:</strong> Recognizing the universal nature of this struggle should create compassion and support within Christian community rather than judgment and isolation.</em></p><h4>Practical Implications</h4><p>Paul’s honest confession has several practical implications for how believers should approach their own struggles with repeated sin:</p><p><em><strong>Honesty: </strong>We can be honest about our struggles without fear that they disqualify us from God’s love.</em></p><p><em><strong>Identity: </strong>We can distinguish between our actions and our identity, recognizing that our failures don’t define who we are in Christ.</em></p><p><em><strong>Dependence: </strong>We can acknowledge our need for ongoing grace and power from God rather than trying to overcome sin through willpower alone.</em></p><p><em><strong>Patience: </strong>We can be patient with the process of sanctification, recognizing that growth takes time and involves setbacks.</em></p><p><em><strong>Community:</strong> We can seek support from other believers who understand the struggle rather than trying to maintain a facade of perfection.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>How does Paul’s honest confession about his internal struggle encourage or challenge your understanding of the Christian life?
