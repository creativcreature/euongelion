And it was so.” — Genesis 1:6–7 (NIV)</p><p>“He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.” — Colossians 1:17 (NIV)</p><p>“The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.” — John 1:14 (NIV)</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart</h2><p>After light, God’s next act is to create order.</p><p>He separates the waters, creating a “vault” or “expanse” (Hebrew: <em>raqia</em>). This act of separation is not about division, but about creating a space for life to exist. Before there can be dry land, there must be a boundary. Before there can be life, there must be a structure to contain it.</p><p>Colossians reveals who is doing this work. The Word who was present in the beginning is the same one in whom all things “hold together.” He is the principle of order, the one who keeps the chaos at bay.</p><p>Creation is not a one-time event. It is a continuous act of holding things together.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Reflection</h2><p>If God’s first act of ordering the world was to set a boundary, then healthy boundaries are not restrictive, but life-giving.</p><p>Where in your life do you need to establish a boundary, not to push something away, but to create a space for something new to grow? What area of your life feels like a chaotic flood, and what would it look like to ask God to create a “vault” of separation and peace?</p><p><strong>Take a moment.</strong> God’s order is not about control, but about creating the conditions for flourishing.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Prayer</h2><blockquote><p>“When he established the heavens, I was there; when he drew a circle on the face of the deep, when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep, when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command...” — Proverbs 8:27–29 (ESV)</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

challenge. They were alive, but they were still trapped half a mile underground. The space that had been their tomb was now their temporary home, but it was a chaotic and dangerous one. The air was hot and humid, sanitation was a major concern, and the psychological toll of their confinement was immense. The initial euphoria of being found quickly gave way to the daunting reality of their situation. They had light, but they did not yet have order.</p><p>The first step in bringing order was the creation of a lifeline. The rescue team on the surface widened the initial borehole and established a system of “palomas” (doves), which were long, thin plastic tubes used to send supplies down to the men. Through these narrow umbilical cords, they sent water, food, medicine, and letters from their families. They established a boundary between the toxic environment of the mine and the life-giving supplies from the surface. The <em>palomas</em> were a tangible separation, a vault that kept the chaos of their situation from overwhelming them.</p><p>This act of separation was a perfect echo of God’s work on the second and third days of creation. After creating light, God separated the waters, creating an expanse. He separated the seas from the dry land. He was creating boundaries, not to divide, but to make a space for life to be sustained. For the miners, the <em>palomas</em> were their <em>raqia</em>, their expanse. They were the structure that held back the chaos and allowed a fragile new world to take shape. The rescue was not yet complete, but through this act of separation, a space had been created where life could be preserved.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: In the face of chaos, God’s first act of salvation is to create a boundary where life can be preserved.</strong></p><div><hr></div><h2>Go Deeper</h2><h4>Scripture Reading</h4><p><strong>Genesis 1:6–10 (NIV)</strong></p><blockquote><p>6 And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.” 7 So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. 8 God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day. 9 And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so. 10 God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Colossians 1:15–17 (NIV)</strong></p><blockquote><p>15 The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. 16 For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. 17 He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h4>What’s Happening in the Text?</h4><p>On Day 2, God creates the “vault” or “expanse” (<em>raqia</em>). This is the atmosphere, the space that separates the waters below (oceans, rivers) from the waters above (clouds, rain). On Day 3, He continues this ordering work by gathering the waters and allowing the dry land to appear. This is a process of differentiation. God is taking the formless chaos of Day 1 and giving it structure.</p><p>Notice the pattern: God speaks, it happens, He names it, and He sees that it is “good.” This is the rhythm of a master artist at work, bringing beauty and order out of a formless medium.</p><p>Colossians tells us that this ordering principle is Christ Himself. The phrase “hold together” (<em>synestēken</em>) means to cohere, to be sustained. Christ is not just the one who created the universe; He is the one who is actively keeping it from falling back into chaos. He is the reason the planets stay in their orbits, the reason the laws of physics are constant. He is the boundary.</p><p>John 1:14 reveals the stunning conclusion of this work: “The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.” The Greek word for “made his dwelling” is <em>eskēnōsen</em>, which literally means “tabernacled” or “pitched his tent.” Just as God created a vault to make space for life, Jesus created a dwelling place within humanity itself. He crossed the ultimate boundary—the separation between Creator and creation—to dwell with us. The one who holds all things together chose to be held in human arms. The one who separated the waters allowed Himself to be baptized in them.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Key Word or Concept</h2><p><em><strong>Raqia</strong></em><strong> (רָקִיעַ)</strong> — translated as “vault,” “expanse,” or “firmament.”</p><p>This Hebrew word comes from a root meaning “to beat out” or “to spread out,” like a metalsmith hammering a piece of metal into a thin sheet. It gives the sense of something solid and supportive.</p><p>The ancient Hebrews saw the sky as a solid dome that held back the waters above. While we now know the science is different, the theological truth remains: God creates firm, reliable structures in our lives to hold back the chaos and create a space for us to live and breathe.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Community Reflection</h2><p><em>If you’re willing, share in the comments:</em></p><blockquote><p>What is one small boundary you can set this week to create a space of peace in your life?</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>This Week’s Journey</h2><p><strong>This is Day 3 of 5.</strong></p><p>Yesterday, we witnessed the arrival of light. Today, we saw God create the first boundary, making a space for life.</p><p>Tomorrow, we will look up at the sun, moon, and stars and discover their true purpose.<br><strong>Below is a link to the study guide document, with a more detailed dive into the scripture. </strong></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/the-word-before-words-week-1-deep?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Deep Dive&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/the-word-before-words-week-1-deep?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true"><span>Deep Dive</span></a></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 4: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
