For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us.” - 1 John 2:19</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Verse: </strong>1 John 2:19 - “They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.”</p><p><strong>Greek Word:</strong> ἐξῆλθαν (Exelthan) - “They went out” or “they departed.” This isn’t a casual leaving but a deliberate departure, often implying rejection or abandonment of what they’re leaving behind.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>What does it mean that perseverance in community is evidence of genuine faith rather than the cause of salvation?</p><p><strong>Urgency Moment:</strong> Look around your Christian community today. Instead of judging who’s “really saved,” ask yourself: “Am I demonstrating the marks of genuine faith through my own perseverance and love?”</p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“Help me examine my own heart for the marks of genuine faith while extending grace to others who may be struggling in their journey.”</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Six weeks into Emma’s treatment, Dr. Sarah Martinez witnessed something that would change her understanding of faith and perseverance forever. Pastor David Chen’s crisis had deepened, but so had his honesty about his struggles. During one of their late-night conversations in the hospital chapel, he shared something that surprised her.</p><p>“Sarah, I need to tell you about Marcus,” David said, referring to his associate pastor. “Three months ago, when Emma was first diagnosed, Marcus came to me and said he was leaving the ministry. He said watching our family suffer had convinced him that either God doesn’t exist or he doesn’t care about his people. He couldn’t continue preaching something he no longer believed.”</p><p>David paused, his voice heavy with pain. “The thing is, Marcus was brilliant. He had a seminary degree, could preach better than me, knew theology inside and out. Everyone in our church thought he was the most spiritual person they knew. But when real suffering entered the picture, his faith just... evaporated.”</p><p>Sarah listened as David continued. “At first, I was devastated. I thought, ‘If Marcus can lose his faith, what hope do any of us have?’ But then I started thinking about the difference between his response and mine. Marcus walked away from God when faith became difficult. I’m wrestling with God, questioning him, even angry at him sometimes—but I can’t walk away. Even in my darkest moments, I find myself praying, reading Scripture, seeking him.”</p><p>David looked at the cross at the front of the chapel. “I think the difference isn’t that I have stronger faith than Marcus had. The difference is that my faith, however weak and struggling, is real. Marcus’s faith, however impressive it looked, was ultimately intellectual rather than relational. When his theology couldn’t explain our suffering, he had nothing left to hold onto.”</p><p>Sarah found herself thinking about her own journey. She had seen many people in her profession struggle with faith in the face of suffering. Some, like Marcus, abandoned their beliefs entirely. Others, like David, wrestled with doubt but couldn’t let go of God. What made the difference?</p><p>“David,” she said slowly, “it sounds like you’re saying that genuine faith isn’t about having all the answers or never struggling with doubt. It’s about having a relationship that survives even when the answers don’t come easily.”</p><p>David nodded. “I think that’s exactly right. Real faith isn’t the absence of questions—it’s the presence of a relationship that’s stronger than our questions.”</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Genuine faith is distinguished not by the absence of struggle but by perseverance through struggle, not by perfect understanding but by persistent relationship with God.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Historical and Community Focus:<br>Distinguishing True from False Believers in the Early Church</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: 1 John 2:18-27 (NIV)<br></strong><em>18 Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. 20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. 21 I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth.22 Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist—denying the Father and the Son. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. 24 As for you, see that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it remains in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is what he has promised us—eternal life.</em></p></blockquote><h4>The Historical Context of False Teachers</h4><p>John’s first letter was written to Christian communities facing the challenge of false teachers who had emerged from within their own ranks. These weren’t outside persecutors but people who had been part of the Christian community, had participated in worship and fellowship, and had claimed to be believers.</p><p><strong>The specific false teaching appears to have been an early form of Gnosticism, which claimed that:</strong></p><p>• Jesus wasn’t truly human (docetism)<br>• Salvation came through special knowledge rather than faith in Christ<br>• Moral behavior was irrelevant to spiritual status<br>• The physical world was evil and only the spiritual realm mattered</p><h4>The Problem of Apparent Believers</h4><p>The challenge facing John’s readers was practical: How do you identify genuine believers when false teachers can appear spiritually mature, theologically sophisticated, and personally compelling? These false teachers weren’t obviously evil people—they were persuasive leaders who had gained followings within Christian communities.</p><p>John’s response is to point to the evidence of departure itself. The fact that these teachers left the Christian community revealed something that had been true all along: they never genuinely belonged to it in the first place.</p><h4>The Logic of Perseverance</h4><p>John’s argument follows a clear logical structure:</p><p><em><strong>Premise 1:</strong> Genuine believers belong to the community of faith in a way that creates lasting connection.</em></p><p><em><strong>Premise 2:</strong> Those who truly belong will persevere in that belonging, even through difficulties and challenges.</em></p><p><em><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Therefore, those who permanently depart demonstrate that they never genuinely belonged.</em></p><p>This isn’t about temporary struggles, doubts, or even periods of distance from the community. John is describing people who definitively reject the faith they once professed and separate themselves from the Christian community entirely.</p><h4>The Nature of True Belonging</h4><p>When John says the false teachers “did not really belong to us,” he’s making a statement about spiritual reality rather than just organizational membership. True belonging to the Christian community involves:</p><p><em><strong>Spiritual Union:</strong> Genuine believers are united to Christ in a way that creates lasting connection to his body, the church.</em></p><p><em><strong>Shared Life:</strong> True Christians share the same spiritual life that flows from Christ, creating natural affinity and connection with other believers.</em></p><p><em><strong>Common Foundation:</strong> Authentic faith rests on the same foundation—the person and work of Jesus Christ—creating unity even amid diversity.</em></p><p><em><strong>Mutual Love:</strong> Real believers are characterized by love for one another, which John identifies as a key mark of genuine faith (1 John 3:14).</em></p><h4>The Test of Christology</h4><p>John identifies a specific doctrinal test for genuine faith: acknowledgment that “Jesus is the Christ” (v. 22). This wasn’t just intellectual assent to a theological proposition but recognition of Jesus’s identity as both fully human and fully divine, the promised Messiah who accomplished salvation through his incarnation, death, and resurrection.</p><p>The false teachers were denying some aspect of Jesus’s person or work, which John identifies as the root of their departure from the faith. Genuine believers may struggle with many questions and doubts, but they maintain fundamental commitment to the biblical understanding of who Jesus is and what he accomplished.</p><h4>The Role of the Holy Spirit</h4><p>John reminds his readers that they “have an anointing from the Holy One” (v. 20), referring to the Holy Spirit’s work in the lives of genuine believers. This anointing enables them to:</p><p><em><strong>Discern Truth:</strong> The Spirit helps believers recognize false teaching and distinguish it from authentic Christian doctrine.</em></p><p><em><strong>Remain Faithful: </strong>The Spirit’s presence provides the power to persevere in faith even when facing challenges and temptations.</em></p><p><em><strong>Maintain Connection:</strong> The Spirit creates and sustains the believer’s union with Christ and connection to the Christian community.</em></p><h4>The Assurance for True Believers</h4><p>While John’s teaching might seem to create anxiety (”How can I know if I really belong?”), his purpose is actually to provide assurance to genuine believers. He’s writing to encourage those who are remaining faithful despite the confusion created by false teachers.</p><p>The marks of genuine faith that John identifies throughout his letter include:</p><p><em><strong>Doctrinal Faithfulness:</strong> Maintaining commitment to the truth about Jesus Christ (1 John 2:22-23).</em></p><p><em><strong>Moral Transformation: </strong>Growing in righteousness and decreasing in sin (1 John 3:6-9).</em></p><p><em><strong>Love for Others:</strong> Demonstrating genuine love for fellow believers (1 John 3:14-18).</em></p><p><em><strong>Perseverance: </strong>Continuing in faith and community despite challenges (1 John 2:19).</em></p><h4>The Difference Between Struggle and Departure</h4><p>John’s teaching helps distinguish between normal spiritual struggles and the kind of departure that indicates false faith:</p><p><em><strong>Struggle:</strong> Genuine believers may wrestle with doubt, experience periods of spiritual dryness, or even temporarily distance themselves from Christian community while still maintaining fundamental commitment to Christ.</em></p><p><em><strong>Departure: </strong>False believers ultimately reject core Christian truths, abandon the Christian community entirely, and often become opponents of the faith they once professed.</em></p><p>The key difference is direction and destination. Genuine believers may wander but ultimately return; false believers depart and don’t come back.</p><h4>Implications for Church Community</h4><p>John’s teaching has important implications for how Christian communities should understand membership, discipline, and assurance:</p><p><em><strong>Patience with Strugglers: </strong>Communities should be patient with those who are wrestling with doubts or going through difficult seasons, recognizing that struggle doesn’t indicate false faith.</em></p><p><em><strong>Clarity about Truth: </strong>Communities must maintain clear commitment to essential Christian doctrines, particularly the truth about Jesus Christ.</em></p><p><em><strong>Love and Support: </strong>The quality of love within Christian community serves both as a mark of genuine faith and a means of encouraging perseverance.</em></p><p><em><strong>Realistic Expectations: </strong>Communities should expect that some who appear to be believers will ultimately prove not to be, without becoming suspicious or judgmental toward those who are struggling.</em></p><h4>The Comfort for Doubters</h4><p>For those who are experiencing doubt or spiritual struggle, John’s teaching provides comfort rather than condemnation. The very fact that you’re concerned about the authenticity of your faith may itself be evidence that your faith is genuine. Those who have truly departed from the faith typically don’t worry about whether they belong to Christ.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>How do you distinguish between healthy spiritual struggle and the kind of departure from faith that John describes?

These are crucial for understanding the relationship between faith, perseverance, and evidence of salvation.</p><h4>Temporal Participles (Time)</h4><p><strong>Participles can express: Antecedent Time: </strong>Action before the main verb <br><strong>Simultaneous Time: </strong>Action at the same time as the main verb <br><strong>Subsequent Time:</strong> Action after the main verb</p><h4>Causal Participles (Cause/Reason)</h4><p><strong>Participles can also express why something happens:</strong></p><p>ἐξελθόντες (exelthontes) - “having gone out” (because they went out) <br>μὴ ὄντες (me ontes) - “not being” (because they were not)</p><h4>John’s Logic in Greek</h4><p>ἐξ ἡμῶν ἐξῆλθαν, ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἦσαν ἐξ ἡμῶν <br>(ex hemon exelthan, all’ ouk esan ex hemon) <br>“They went out from us, but they were not of us”</p><p>εἰ γὰρ ἐξ ἡμῶν ἦσαν, μεμενήκεισαν ἂν μεθ’ ἡμῶν <br>(ei gar ex hemon esan, memenekeisan an meth’ hemon) <br>“For if they had been of us, they would have remained with us”</p><h4>Key Participle Vocabulary</h4><p>ἐξερχόμενος (exerchomenos) - “going out” (present participle) <br>ἐξελθών (exelthon) - “having gone out” (aorist participle) <br>μένων (menon) - “remaining” (present participle) <br>μείνας (meinas) - “having remained” (aorist participle)</p><h4>Participles Showing Evidence</h4><p>δεικνύντες (deiknyntes) - “showing” or “demonstrating” <br>φανερωθέντες (phanerothentes) - “having been revealed”</p><h4>The Grammar of Belonging</h4><p>ἐκ (ek) + genitive = “from” or “of” (source/origin) <br>ἐξ ἡμῶν (ex hemon) = “from us” or “of us” <br>μετὰ (meta) + genitive = “with” <br>μεθ’ ἡμῶν (meth’ hemon) = “with us”</p><h4>Reading Practice</h4><p>ἵνα φανερωθῶσιν ὅτι οὐκ εἰσὶν πάντες ἐξ ἡμῶν <br>(hina phanerothossin hoti ouk eisin pantes ex hemon) <br>“in order that it might be revealed that not all are of us”</p><h4>Participles as Evidence</h4><p>μαρτυρῶν (martyron) - “witnessing” or “testifying” <br>δεικνύων (deiknyon) - “showing” or “proving”</p><h4>Memory Tip</h4><p>Causal participles answer “Why?” - ἐξελθόντες = “having gone out” (which shows why we know they weren’t really of us)</p><h4>Practice Exercise</h4><p><strong>Identify the function:</strong></p><ol><li><p>ἐξελθόντες = ?

How do we apply John’s teaching about genuine versus false faith to our modern situations? What does perseverance look like in a culture that values individual choice and personal autonomy? We’ll also see Dr. Martinez reach her own conclusions about faith and doubt.</p><p><em><strong>Don’t miss Day 4:</strong> The Lesson for Me Today - when ancient wisdom meets modern questions.</em></p><div><hr></div><p><em>This is Day 3 of our 6-day series “Once Saved, Always Saved?”[<a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/once-saved-always-saved-day-16-week?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">Da y 1</a>] | [<a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/once-saved-always-saved-day-26-week?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">Day 2</a>]  | [Day 3] | Coming Tomorrow: Day 4 - The Lesson for Me Today</em></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 4: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
