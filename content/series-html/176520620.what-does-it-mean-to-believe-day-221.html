John 20:28</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Verse: </strong>John 20:27 - “Then he said to Thomas, ‘Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.’”</p><p><strong>Greek Word: </strong>ἴδε (Ide) - “See” or “look.” This is an imperative—a command to observe carefully. Jesus isn’t just showing Thomas evidence; he’s commanding him to examine it thoroughly.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question:</strong> How do I respond when I receive evidence that challenges my assumptions about what’s possible?</p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“Give me the courage to examine evidence honestly, even when it might require me to change my fundamental beliefs about reality.”</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Three weeks into her investigation, Dr. Sarah Chen found herself in an impossible position. She had traveled to Houston to interview Dr. Martinez, the lead researcher behind the controversial cancer treatment. What she expected to find was a charlatan or, at best, a well-meaning scientist who had misinterpreted his data.</p><p>Instead, she found meticulous documentation. Patient files with before-and-after scans showing tumors disappearing. Independent lab results confirming the treatment’s effectiveness. Video testimonials from patients who had been given weeks to live and were now cancer-free months later. Dr. Martinez didn’t just tell her about the results—he showed her everything, opened his files, introduced her to patients, and even arranged for her to speak with skeptical oncologists who had initially dismissed his work but were now referring patients to him.</p><p>“I know how this sounds,” Dr. Martinez said, pulling up another set of scans on his computer. “I was skeptical too when we first saw these results. I made the team run the tests three times. I brought in outside consultants to verify our methodology. I wanted to be wrong—it would have been easier to be wrong.”</p><p>Sarah stared at the evidence spread across his desk. As a journalist, she had developed finely tuned instincts for detecting fraud, manipulation, and wishful thinking. But everything she was seeing suggested that this impossible-seeming treatment was actually working. The question was no longer whether the evidence was real—it was what she was going to do with evidence that challenged everything she thought she knew about cancer treatment.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Sometimes the most challenging moment isn’t when we lack evidence, but when we’re confronted with evidence that demands we reconsider our fundamental assumptions about reality.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Prophetic and Theological Focus:<br>When Evidence Meets Faith</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: John 20:26-29 (NIV)</strong><br><em>26 A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” 27 Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.”28 Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”29 Then Jesus told him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”</em></p></blockquote><h4>The Connection to Old Testament Expectation</h4><p>John’s account of Thomas connects to a broader biblical theme about the relationship between seeing and believing. Throughout the Hebrew Scriptures, God accommodates human need for evidence while also calling people to faith that goes beyond physical sight.</p><p>Moses asked for signs when God called him to lead Israel out of Egypt (Exodus 4:1-9), and God provided them. Gideon requested multiple confirmations before leading Israel against the Midianites (Judges 6:36-40), and God patiently provided each one. Even the prophet Elijah, in his moment of despair, was given a dramatic demonstration of God’s power (1 Kings 19:11-13).</p><p>The pattern throughout Scripture is that God takes honest doubt seriously and often provides evidence to those who genuinely seek it. Thomas’s story fits this pattern—his skepticism isn’t punished but addressed.</p><h4>Jesus’s Response to Skepticism</h4><p>What’s remarkable about Jesus’s response is how specifically it addresses Thomas’s stated requirements. Thomas had said, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.” Jesus responds by offering exactly that: “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side.”</p><p><strong>This suggests several important things about the nature of faith and evidence:</strong></p><p><em><strong>Evidence is Important:</strong> Jesus doesn’t dismiss Thomas’s need for proof as faithless or inappropriate. He takes the request seriously and provides what was asked for.</em></p><p><em><strong>Evidence is Personal:</strong> Jesus doesn’t just provide generic proof of resurrection; he offers the specific evidence that would be meaningful to Thomas based on his stated criteria.</em></p><p><em><strong>Evidence Leads to Decision:</strong> After providing the evidence, Jesus calls for a response: “Stop doubting and believe.” Evidence alone isn’t the goal—it’s meant to lead to trust and commitment.</em></p><h4>The Nature of Thomas’s Response</h4><p>Thomas’s response to the evidence is immediate and profound: “My Lord and my God!” This isn’t just acknowledgment that Jesus is alive—it’s a declaration of Jesus’s divine identity and Thomas’s personal allegiance to him.</p><p>The Greek phrase is <em>“Ho kyrios mou kai ho theos mou”</em>—literally “The Lord of me and the God of me.” This is one of the clearest declarations of Jesus’s divinity in the New Testament, and it comes from the mouth of the skeptic who had demanded the most rigorous proof.</p><h4>The Blessing for Future Believers</h4><p>Jesus’s final statement in this passage addresses those who, unlike Thomas, cannot physically examine his wounds: “Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.” This isn’t a criticism of Thomas but a recognition that most people throughout history would need to make their decision about Jesus based on testimony rather than direct physical evidence.</p><p>This creates an interesting dynamic for modern readers. We’re in the position of those who “have not seen,” but we have the testimony of those who did see—including Thomas, whose rigorous skepticism makes his eventual belief particularly compelling.</p><h4>The Question of Sufficient Evidence</h4><p>Thomas’s story raises important questions about what constitutes sufficient evidence for extraordinary claims. Thomas received exactly the proof he requested, but what about those of us who cannot physically examine Jesus’s wounds?</p><p><strong>John suggests that we have access to a different kind of evidence: </strong>the testimony of credible witnesses, the historical impact of Jesus’s life and teaching, the transformation of his followers, and the ongoing effects of the Gospel message throughout history. The question is whether this cumulative evidence is sufficient to warrant the kind of trust and commitment that Thomas demonstrated.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>If you had been in Thomas’s position, what kind of evidence would you have requested? How do you typically evaluate extraordinary claims?</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p>Jesus provided the physical evidence Thomas requested, but he also spoke of blessing for those who believe without seeing. How do you balance the need for evidence with the recognition that some things must be accepted on trust?</p></li></ol><ol start="3"><li><p>Thomas’s response to the evidence was immediate and total: “My Lord and my God!” What does this suggest about the relationship between intellectual conviction and personal commitment?</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h3>Share Your Thoughts</h3><p>How does Jesus’s willingness to provide evidence to Thomas affect your understanding of the relationship between faith and reason?
