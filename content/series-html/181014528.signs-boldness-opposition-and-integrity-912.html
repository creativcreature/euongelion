Instead, they speak with clarity, courage, and calm confidence.</p><p><strong>Greek Word:</strong><br><strong>παρρησία (parrēsia)</strong> – “boldness,” “confident openness,” “freedom to speak without fear.”<br>This boldness is not arrogance or recklessness. It is the quiet, steady courage that comes from knowing who Jesus is and being filled with His Spirit.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>What’s Happening in Acts 4?</strong></h2><p>Yesterday we saw the miracle and the sermon.<br>Today we see the consequences.</p><p>The religious leaders arrest Peter and John not because the healing was questionable but because the <em>message</em> was undeniable. The resurrection of Jesus threatens:</p><p>• their authority<br>• their theological framework<br>• their political stability</p><p>So they interrogate Peter and John with a loaded question:<br><strong>“By what power or what name did you do this?”</strong></p><p>Peter answers full of the Spirit — but without hostility.<br>He simply says the truth:</p><p><strong>“It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead…”</strong></p><p>The council is stunned. These are ordinary men with extraordinary courage. Their boldness exposes the council’s fear.</p><p>The authorities threaten them, but Peter and John’s answer becomes a defining statement for all Christian witness:</p><p><strong>“We cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.”</strong></p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Reflection Question</strong></h2><p>Where do I feel pressure to silence or soften my faith — and what might Spirit-filled boldness look like there?</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Urgency Moment</strong></h2><p>Take 3–5 minutes and pray specifically for <strong>parrēsia</strong> — courage rooted not in personality but in presence:</p><p><strong>“Jesus, let me speak with the boldness that comes from being with You.”</strong></p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Prayer</strong></h2><p>“Holy Spirit, give me courage that is gentle and firm. Teach me to speak truth with love, to stand without fear, and to rely on Your strength rather than my own. When pressure comes, let me remember that I belong to You. Amen.”</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Story Time (5 Minutes)</strong></h1><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyBH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1c51e0d-0f67-4609-b6ba-02d06838f1b8_1920x1024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyBH!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1c51e0d-0f67-4609-b6ba-02d06838f1b8_1920x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyBH!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1c51e0d-0f67-4609-b6ba-02d06838f1b8_1920x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyBH!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1c51e0d-0f67-4609-b6ba-02d06838f1b8_1920x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyBH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1c51e0d-0f67-4609-b6ba-02d06838f1b8_1920x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a1c51e0d-0f67-4609-b6ba-02d06838f1b8_1920x1024.jpeg" width="1456" height="777" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a1c51e0d-0f67-4609-b6ba-02d06838f1b8_1920x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:777,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:892142,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/i/181014528?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1c51e0d-0f67-4609-b6ba-02d06838f1b8_1920x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyBH!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1c51e0d-0f67-4609-b6ba-02d06838f1b8_1920x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyBH!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1c51e0d-0f67-4609-b6ba-02d06838f1b8_1920x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyBH!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1c51e0d-0f67-4609-b6ba-02d06838f1b8_1920x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyBH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1c51e0d-0f67-4609-b6ba-02d06838f1b8_1920x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Part 3 of a 5-Day True Story: When Opposition Organizes</strong></p><p>By 1789, Wilberforce’s campaign to end the British slave trade had gained public traction — and that meant the opposition had to become more organized. Wealthy shipowners, government officials, and businessmen began to see his efforts as a direct threat to national profit and global influence.</p><p>They did not wait quietly.</p><p>Pamphlets were published calling him a fanatic.<br>Political cartoons mocked him as naïve and delusional.<br>Powerful men whispered in Parliament that he was “destabilizing the empire.”<br>Some even questioned his patriotism.</p><p>The pressure was not only external. Friends warned him that he was isolating himself politically. Influential colleagues told him the cause was hopeless. One member of Parliament, frustrated by Wilberforce’s persistence, reportedly snapped:</p><p><strong>“You may choose to martyr yourself — but do not expect the rest of us to join you.”</strong></p><p>Yet Wilberforce remained steady. He did not meet hostility with hostility. He did not insult, retaliate, or compromise. He simply continued to speak the truth. Calmly. Consistently. Publicly.</p><p>And just like in Acts 4, the opposition found something unnerving about that kind of courage. They expected fire. They found resolve. They expected argument. They found clarity. They expected political maneuvering. They found moral conviction.</p><p>During these years, a group of close friends — later known as the <strong>Clapham community</strong> — gathered around Wilberforce. They prayed with him, encouraged him, and reminded him that the work belonged to God, not to him alone.</p><p>One historian writes that their shared courage “turned the tide of a nation not by force, but by moral endurance.”</p><p>Their boldness grew not from anger, but from abiding in Christ.</p><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong><br>Boldness is not the absence of pressure. It is the refusal to let pressure determine your witness.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Dive Further (5 Minutes)</strong></h2><p>Acts 4 is the blueprint for Christian courage:</p><p>• The apostles are ordinary, untrained men.<br>• The council is highly educated, powerful, and politically connected.<br>• Yet the apostles speak with clarity and confidence because they “had been with Jesus.”</p><p><strong>Boldness is proximity.</strong><br>It is not a personality trait — it is the overflow of presence.</p><p>Three insights to carry with you:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Boldness grows in community</strong> – The apostles stand together, not alone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Boldness is Spirit-given</strong> – It comes <em>after</em> prayer, not before.</p></li><li><p><strong>Boldness tells the truth without hostility</strong> – It is firm but not violent.</p></li></ol><p>If you want to explore how this chapter fits the whole week, revisit the <strong>Week 2 Master Document: Signs, Boldness, Opposition, and Integrity (Acts 3–5)</strong> for deeper context.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/signs-boldness-opposition-and-integrity?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Master Document&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/signs-boldness-opposition-and-integrity?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true"><span>Master Document</span></a></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 4: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
