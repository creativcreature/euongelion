John 20:28</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Verse: </strong>John 20:28 - “My Lord and my God!”</p><p><strong>Greek Concept:</strong> κύριος καὶ θεός (kyrios kai theos) - “Lord and God.” This confession acknowledges both Jesus’s authority over our lives (Lord) and his divine nature (God). Living this confession means allowing both truths to shape our daily decisions.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>How can I live in a way that reflects my belief that Jesus is both my Lord (authority) and my God (worthy of worship)?</p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“Help me to integrate my confession of faith into every aspect of my life, so that my actions align with my beliefs about who Jesus is.”</em></p><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>One year after her controversial article was published, Sarah Chen received an unexpected phone call. Dr. Martinez, the researcher whose cancer treatment she had investigated, was calling to invite her to Houston for a special event. “We’re celebrating our 100th patient to achieve complete remission,” he said. “None of this would have happened without your article. You gave us credibility when the medical establishment was dismissing our work.”</p><p>Sarah flew to Houston and found herself in a room filled with patients, families, doctors, and researchers. As she listened to story after story of people whose lives had been saved by the treatment she had helped bring to public attention, she realized that her decision to follow the evidence—despite the professional cost—had literally saved lives.</p><p>But the most profound moment came when Maria Santos, the mother of three Sarah had interviewed a year earlier, approached her with tears in her eyes. “My daughter just got accepted to medical school,” Maria said. “She wants to become an oncologist because of what happened to me. She says she wants to help other families the way Dr. Martinez helped ours.”</p><p>As Sarah drove back to the airport, she reflected on how her investigation had changed her understanding of truth, evidence, and courage. She had learned that sometimes the most rational thing you can do is believe something that seems impossible, when the evidence demands it. But more than that, she had learned that believing the truth—really believing it, to the point where it changes how you live—can have consequences far beyond what you can imagine.</p><p>Her article hadn’t just reported on a medical breakthrough; it had become part of the story itself. By having the courage to follow the evidence and report what she found, she had helped save lives and advance medical science. Sarah realized that this was what authentic belief looked like: not just intellectual acknowledgment, but commitment that transforms both the believer and the world around them.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Authentic belief isn’t just about what we think—it’s about how we live, and living according to truth can have profound consequences for ourselves and others.</em></p><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Practical Implementation:<br>Living the Confession</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: John 20:24-31 (NIV)</strong><br>24 Now Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. 25 So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!”But he said to them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”26 A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” 27 Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.”28 Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”29 Then Jesus told him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”30 Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. 31 But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</p></blockquote><h4>Understanding the Confession</h4><p>Thomas’s declaration—”My Lord and my God!”—contains two crucial elements that should shape how we live:</p><p><strong>Jesus as Lord (κύριος): </strong>This acknowledges Jesus’s authority over our lives. It means recognizing that he has the right to direct our choices, priorities, and relationships. Lordship isn’t about external compliance but about internal alignment with his will and character.</p><p><strong>Jesus as God (θεός): </strong>This acknowledges Jesus’s divine nature and his worthiness of worship, trust, and ultimate allegiance. It means recognizing that he is the source of truth, meaning, and life itself.</p><h4>Developing a Lord-Centered Identity</h4><p>Living Thomas’s confession begins with allowing our identity to be shaped by our relationship with Jesus rather than by our achievements, failures, or social roles:</p><p><em><strong>Daily Reminder: </strong>Beginning each day by remembering who you are in Christ—loved, forgiven, accepted, and called to purpose. This provides a foundation of security that doesn’t depend on circumstances or performance.<br><strong>Decision-Making Filter: </strong>Before making significant choices, asking: “How does this align with Jesus’s character and teaching? What would it look like to honor him as Lord in this situation?”<br><strong>Identity Statements: </strong>Regularly affirming truths about your identity in Christ: “I am a child of God,” “I am being transformed into Christ’s likeness,” “I have a purpose in God’s kingdom.”</em></p><h4>Practicing Worship and Devotion</h4><p>Acknowledging Jesus as God means developing practices that recognize his divine nature and express our devotion:</p><p><em><strong>Daily Worship: </strong>Setting aside time each day for prayer, Scripture reading, and worship—not as religious duty but as natural response to who Jesus is.<br><strong>Gratitude Practices: </strong>Regularly thanking God for his grace, provision, and presence in your life, recognizing that every good thing comes from him.<br><strong>Sabbath Observance: </strong>Creating regular rhythms of rest and worship that acknowledge God’s sovereignty and our dependence on him.</em></p><h4>Aligning Priorities with Kingdom Values</h4><p>Jesus’s lordship should influence how we approach the major areas of our lives:</p><p><em><strong>Time Management: </strong>Evaluating how you spend your time in light of Jesus’s priorities—loving God and loving others. This might mean adjusting your schedule to include more time for relationships, service, and spiritual growth.<br><strong>Financial Decisions: </strong>Viewing your resources as gifts from God to be used for his purposes, not just personal comfort or security. This could involve more generous giving, simpler living, or more thoughtful consumption.<br><strong>Career Choices: </strong>Considering how your work can serve God’s purposes and benefit others, not just advance your own interests. This doesn’t necessarily mean changing careers, but it might mean changing how you approach your current work.<br><strong>Relationship Priorities: </strong>Investing more deeply in relationships that matter most and approaching all relationships with greater love, forgiveness, and service.</em></p><h4>Cultivating Authentic Faith</h4><p>Thomas’s journey from doubt to faith provides a model for ongoing spiritual growth:</p><p><em><strong>Honest Self-Examination: </strong>Regularly examining your heart and life, acknowledging areas where you fall short of Christ’s example, and seeking his grace and transformation.<br><strong>Continued Learning: </strong>Studying Scripture, reading thoughtful Christian literature, and engaging in discussions that deepen your understanding of faith and its implications.<br><strong>Community Engagement: </strong>Participating in Christian community for mutual encouragement, accountability, and growth. Faith is strengthened when it’s shared and tested in relationship with others.<br><strong>Service and Mission: </strong>Looking for ways to serve others and participate in God’s work in the world, recognizing that faith is meant to be active and transformative.</em></p><h4>Dealing with Ongoing Doubt</h4><p>Even after making Thomas’s confession, most believers continue to wrestle with questions and doubts. This is normal and can actually strengthen faith when handled well:</p><p><em><strong>Embracing Questions: </strong>Viewing doubt as an opportunity for deeper investigation and stronger faith rather than as a sign of spiritual failure.<br><strong>Seeking Answers: </strong>Actively pursuing answers to your questions through study, discussion, and prayer, while being patient with the process of growth.<br><strong>Acting on Conviction: </strong>Moving forward based on what you do believe while continuing to work through areas of uncertainty.</em></p><h4>Measuring Spiritual Progress</h4><p><strong>How do we know if we’re successfully living Thomas’s confession? Some indicators include:</strong></p><p><em><strong>Increased Peace: </strong>Growing sense of security and contentment that doesn’t depend on external circumstances.<br><strong>Greater Love:</strong> More patience, kindness, and compassion in your relationships with others.<br><strong>Clearer Purpose: </strong>Better understanding of why you’re here and how your life fits into God’s larger purposes.<br><strong>Moral Growth: </strong>Progress in areas where you previously struggled with temptation or character issues.<br><strong>Deeper Joy: </strong>Not just happiness based on circumstances, but a deeper satisfaction that comes from knowing you’re living according to your true purpose.</em></p><h4>The Ripple Effect of Authentic Faith</h4><p>Like Sarah Chen’s article, authentic faith has consequences that extend far beyond the believer. When we truly live as people who believe Jesus is Lord and God, it affects our families, communities, and the broader world:</p><p><em><strong>Transformed Relationships: </strong>Our marriages, friendships, and family relationships become more loving, forgiving, and life-giving.<br><strong>Positive Community Impact: </strong>We become people who contribute to justice, compassion, and human flourishing in our communities.<br><strong>Authentic Witness: </strong>Our lives become a testimony to the reality and goodness of God, drawing others to investigate the faith for themselves.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>What specific changes will you make this week to better align your daily life with Thomas’s confession that Jesus is “My Lord and my God”?</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p>Which areas of your life—time, money, relationships, career—most need to be influenced by your faith?
