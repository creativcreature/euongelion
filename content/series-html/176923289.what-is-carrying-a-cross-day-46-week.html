Matthew 16:25</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Verse:</strong> Matthew 16:25 - “For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.”</p><p><strong>Greek Word: </strong>ψυχή (Psyche) - “Life” or “soul.” This refers to the essential self—not just biological existence but the core of who we are, our identity, purpose, and deepest desires.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>What would it mean to “lose my life” for Jesus’s sake in my current circumstances and cultural context?<br><strong><br>Urgency Moment:</strong> Stop scrolling. Stop planning. Right now, identify the one thing you’re afraid to sacrifice for Jesus. Don’t rationalize it away. Pray about it. Then take one concrete step toward letting it go this week.</p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“Help me understand how to live as a cross-bearing disciple in my contemporary world, and give me the courage to make the necessary changes.”</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Dr. Michael Rodriguez made his decision on a Tuesday morning in March. He had spent weeks wrestling with the choice between Johns Hopkins and Guatemala, between conventional success and uncertain service. The turning point came when he received a video message from Dr. Patterson, the surgeon who had founded the Guatemala clinic twenty years earlier.</p><p>“Michael, I want to be honest with you about what you’re considering,” Dr. Patterson said from his simple office in the rural clinic. “This isn’t a romantic adventure or a short-term mission trip. It’s hard work, limited resources, and constant challenges. You’ll perform surgeries in conditions that would horrify your colleagues back home. You’ll live simply, earn little, and watch some patients die because we don’t have the equipment to save them.”</p><p>But then Dr. Patterson’s expression changed. “But I also want you to know that this work will change you in ways you can’t imagine. You’ll discover what it means to practice medicine as it was meant to be practiced—focused entirely on healing rather than profit. You’ll train local doctors who will serve their communities for decades. You’ll be part of something that matters in ways that go far beyond your individual career.”</p><p>Michael closed his laptop and walked to his office window, looking out at the parking lot filled with luxury cars belonging to his colleagues. He thought about the comfortable life he had built, the respect he had earned, the financial security he enjoyed. Then he thought about the thousands of people in Guatemala who would die from treatable heart conditions if no one was willing to help them.</p><p>That afternoon, Michael called Johns Hopkins to decline their offer. Then he called Dr. Kim to accept the position in Guatemala. As he hung up the phone, he felt a mixture of terror and excitement that he had never experienced before. He was giving up everything he had worked for, but for the first time in years, he felt like he was moving toward something rather than just climbing a ladder.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Sometimes the most rational thing we can do is choose a path that looks irrational by conventional standards, when that path aligns with our deepest values and purposes.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Contemporary Application:<br>Cross-Bearing in a Consumer Culture</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: Matthew 16:24-27 (NIV)</strong><br><em>24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. 25 For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it. 26 What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul? 27 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.”</em></p></blockquote><h4>The Challenge of Comfort</h4><p>Most contemporary Christians in the developed world live in circumstances of unprecedented comfort and security compared to Jesus’s original audience. We don’t face the immediate threat of crucifixion for following Jesus, and our basic needs for food, shelter, and safety are generally met. This creates both opportunities and challenges for cross-bearing discipleship.</p><p>The opportunity is that we have resources, freedom, and influence that can be used for kingdom purposes. The challenge is that comfort can insulate us from the kind of dependence on God and solidarity with others that characterized early Christian communities.</p><h4>Redefining Self-Denial</h4><p>In our cultural context, “self-denial” can’t simply mean asceticism or self-punishment. Instead, it means choosing God’s definition of the good life over culture’s definition, even when that choice involves sacrifice or goes against social expectations.</p><p><strong>This might involve:</strong></p><p><em><strong>Lifestyle Choices:</strong> Living more simply than our income would allow in order to be more generous with others, choosing careers based on calling rather than just salary, or making consumer decisions based on ethical considerations rather than just personal preference.</em></p><p><em><strong>Time Priorities: </strong>Choosing to invest time in relationships, service, and spiritual growth rather than just career advancement or entertainment, even when this means saying no to opportunities that would enhance our status or comfort.</em></p><p><em><strong>Moral Courage: </strong>Standing for truth and justice even when it’s unpopular or costly, refusing to participate in systems that harm others even when participation would benefit us personally.</em></p><h4>The Paradox of Self-Actualization</h4><p>Our culture promotes self-actualization and personal fulfillment as the highest goals of life. Jesus’s teaching suggests a different path: that authentic fulfillment comes not through self-assertion but through self-sacrifice, not through getting what we want but through giving ourselves to something greater than our individual desires.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that personal growth and fulfillment are wrong, but that they come as byproducts of living for purposes larger than ourselves rather than as direct goals to be pursued.</p><h4>Cross-Bearing in Relationships</h4><p>One of the most practical areas for cross-bearing discipleship is in our relationships—with family, friends, colleagues, and neighbors. This might involve:</p><p><em><strong>Forgiveness: </strong>Choosing to forgive those who have hurt us, even when they don’t deserve it or ask for it, because forgiveness serves God’s purposes of reconciliation and healing.</em></p><p><em><strong>Service: </strong>Prioritizing others’ needs and well-being over our own convenience or preferences, looking for ways to serve rather than just be served.</em></p><p><em><strong>Difficult Conversations: </strong>Speaking truth in love even when it’s uncomfortable, addressing injustice or harmful behavior rather than avoiding conflict.</em></p><p><em><strong>Sacrificial Love:</strong> Choosing to love people who are difficult to love, investing in relationships that don’t provide obvious benefits to us.</em></p><h4>Economic Discipleship</h4><p>Jesus’s teaching about not being able to serve both God and money (Matthew 6:24) has direct implications for how we handle our financial resources. Cross-bearing discipleship might involve:</p><p><em><strong>Generous Giving:</strong> Contributing significantly to causes that serve God’s kingdom, even when this requires lifestyle adjustments or sacrifices.</em></p><p><em><strong>Ethical Investing:</strong> Making financial decisions based on kingdom values rather than just maximum return, avoiding investments that harm others or exploit the vulnerable.</em></p><p><em><strong>Career Choices:</strong> Choosing work that serves human flourishing rather than just personal advancement, even when this means lower pay or less prestige.</em></p><p><em><strong>Simple Living:</strong> Resisting the cultural pressure to constantly upgrade our lifestyle, finding contentment with enough rather than always wanting more.</em></p><h4>Social and Political Engagement</h4><p>While Jesus’s kingdom is not of this world, his followers are called to work for justice and human flourishing within this world. Cross-bearing discipleship might involve:</p><p><em><strong>Advocacy:</strong> Speaking up for those who are marginalized or oppressed, even when this puts us at odds with popular opinion or powerful interests.</em></p><p><em><strong>Service:</strong> Volunteering time and resources to address social problems, working with organizations that serve the poor, the sick, or the vulnerable.</em></p><p><em><strong>Prophetic Witness:</strong> Challenging systems and structures that perpetuate injustice, even when this creates personal or professional costs.</em></p><h4>The Role of Community</h4><p>Cross-bearing discipleship isn’t meant to be a solitary endeavor. We need Christian community to support, encourage, and hold us accountable in living this way of life. This might involve:</p><p><em><strong>Mutual Accountability:</strong> Being part of relationships where others can challenge us when we’re living for ourselves rather than for God’s kingdom.</em></p><p><em><strong>Shared Resources:</strong> Participating in communities that practice economic sharing and mutual support, reducing our individual need for security and enabling greater generosity.</em></p><p><em><strong>Collective Action: </strong>Working with other Christians to address problems that are too big for individual responses, pooling our resources and influence for kingdom purposes.</em></p><h4>Dealing with Failure and Growth</h4><p>Most of us will find that we fall short of Jesus’s call to cross-bearing discipleship. The key is to view this as an opportunity for growth rather than a reason for despair. Cross-bearing is a lifelong process of learning to align our lives more fully with God’s purposes.</p><p>This involves regular self-examination, confession when we fall short, and recommitment to following Jesus more faithfully. It also involves accepting God’s grace and forgiveness when we fail, and allowing that grace to motivate continued growth rather than complacency.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>In what specific areas of your life do you sense God calling you to greater self-denial or sacrifice for the sake of his kingdom?</p></li><li><p>How does your culture’s definition of success and fulfillment conflict with Jesus’s teaching about losing your life to find it? Where do you feel this tension most acutely?</p></li><li><p>What would it look like for you to “take up your cross” in your current relationships, work, and community involvement?</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h3>Share Your Thoughts</h3><p>How does Jesus’s call to cross-bearing discipleship challenge or resonate with your understanding of what it means to live a meaningful life?

Jesus often uses subjunctives in his teaching about discipleship.</p><h4>The Subjunctive Mood</h4><p>The subjunctive is used for:<br>• Conditions (”if someone wants...”)<br>• Purposes (”in order that...”)<br>• Possibilities (”whoever might...”)<br>• Commands (indirect commands)</p><h4>Subjunctive Forms of θέλω (to want/wish)</h4><p>θέλω (thelo) - “I want” (indicative) θέλῃ (thele) - “he/she might want” (subjunctive)<br>ἀκολουθέω (akoloutheo) - “I follow” (indicative) ἀκολουθῇ (akolouthe) - “he/she might follow” (subjunctive)</p><h4>Jesus’s Conditional Statement</h4><p>εἰ τις θέλει ὀπίσω μου ἔρχεσθαι <br>(ei tis thelei opiso mou erchesthai) <br>“If anyone wants to come after me”</p><p><strong>Breaking it down:</strong></p><p>•εἰ (ei) - “if”<br>•τις (tis) - “anyone” or “someone”<br>•θέλει (thelei) - “wants” (present indicative)<br>•ὀπίσω (opiso) - “behind” or “after”<br>•μου (mou) - “me”<br>•ἔρχεσθαι (erchesthai) - “to come” (infinitive)</p><h4>Common Conditional Patterns</h4><p>First Class Conditions (assumed true): εἰ + indicative = “if (and it’s true that)...”<br>Third Class Conditions (possible but uncertain): ἐὰν + subjunctive = “if (it might happen that)...”</p><h4>Key Conditional Vocabulary</h4><p>εἰ (ei) - “if” (with indicative) <br>ἐὰν (ean) - “if” (with subjunctive) <br>ὅς (hos) - “who” or “whoever” <br>τις (tis) - “someone” or “anyone”</p><h4>Reading Practice</h4><p>ὃς ἂν θέλῃ (hos an thele) “whoever might want”<br>ἐὰν τις ἀκολουθῇ (ean tis akolouthe) “if anyone should follow”</p><h4>Memory Tip</h4><p>Subjunctive endings often have long vowels (η, ω) - think of them as “stretching” into possibility rather than stating certainty!</p><h4>Practice Exercise</h4><p><strong>Identify the mood:</strong></p><ol><li><p>θέλει = ? (indicative or subjunctive?)</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p>θέλῃ = ? (indicative or subjunctive?)</p></li></ol><ol start="3"><li><p>ἀκολουθεῖ = ?

If Jesus’s call to take up our cross resonates with us, how do we respond? What practical steps can we take to move from intellectual appreciation to actual discipleship? We’ll also see the outcome of Dr. Rodriguez’s decision.</p><p><em><strong>Don’t miss Day 5:</strong> What Am I Going to Do About It? - from understanding to commitment.</em></p><div><hr></div><p><em>This is Day 4 of our 6-day series “What is Carrying a Cross?”[<a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/what-is-carrying-a-cross-day-16-week?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">Day 1</a>] | [<a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/what-is-carrying-a-cross-day-26-week?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">Day 2</a>] | [<a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/why-jesus-day-16-week-18?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">Day 3</a>] | Coming Tomorrow: Day 5 - What Am I Going to Do About It?</em></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 5: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
