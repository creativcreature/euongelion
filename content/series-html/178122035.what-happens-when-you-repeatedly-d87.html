Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?” - Romans 6:1-2</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><em><strong>Today’s Verse: </strong>Romans 6:1-2 - “What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?”</em></p><p><em><strong>Greek Word: </strong>μή γένοιτο (Me genoito) - “By no means!” or “God forbid!” This is Paul’s strongest possible rejection of an idea—the most emphatic way to say “absolutely not” in Greek.</em></p><p><em><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>How does understanding that I have “died to sin” change my relationship to patterns of behavior that once controlled me?</em></p><p><em><strong>Urgency Moment: </strong>Stop using God’s grace as an excuse for continued sin. Identify one area where you’ve been presuming on his forgiveness instead of seeking his power for transformation.</em></p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“Help me understand what it means to have died to sin and to live in the power of your resurrection.”</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>One month after his conversation with Pastor Williams, Marcus Thompson found himself in an unexpected situation. His gambling addiction support group had asked him to share his story with a new member—a young man named Jake who was struggling with the same issues Marcus had faced.</p><p>“The thing is,” Jake said after Marcus had shared about his repeated failures and God’s ongoing forgiveness, “it sounds like you’re saying God will just keep forgiving me no matter how many times I mess up. So why should I even try to stop? If his grace covers everything, maybe I should just accept that I’m going to be a gambling addict and trust that God will forgive me each time.”</p><p>Marcus felt a chill as he recognized his own thinking from just a few months earlier. He had used God’s promise of forgiveness as a kind of insurance policy—a safety net that allowed him to continue in destructive behavior without fully confronting the need for change.</p><p>“Jake, I understand why you’d think that way because I thought the same thing,” Marcus replied. “But I’ve learned there’s a huge difference between struggling with sin and using grace as an excuse to keep sinning. When I was using God’s forgiveness as a license to gamble, I wasn’t really repenting—I was just managing my guilt.”</p><p>Marcus paused, remembering his own journey. “Real repentance isn’t just feeling sorry about the consequences of sin. It’s recognizing that the sin itself is incompatible with who I am in Christ. When I gamble, I’m not just making a poor choice—I’m acting like someone who doesn’t trust God to provide for my needs, someone who thinks I can find satisfaction in something other than him.”</p><p>Jake looked skeptical. “But you said you’ve failed repeatedly. How is that different from what I’m talking about?”</p><p>“The difference is direction and desire,” Marcus explained. “When I fail now, it grieves me because it contradicts who I know I am in Christ. I don’t want to gamble—it feels foreign to my new nature. Before, when I was using grace as a license, I wanted to gamble and was just looking for a way to manage the guilt. The struggle itself is evidence that God is changing me, even when I don’t see perfect victory.”</p><p>Marcus opened his Bible to Romans 6. “Paul addresses this exact question. Some people in the early church were apparently saying, ‘If grace increases where sin abounds, let’s sin more so grace can abound even more.’ Paul’s response is basically, ‘Are you crazy? That completely misunderstands what grace does to us.’”</p><p>As their conversation continued, Marcus realized that his own understanding of grace had been transformed through his struggle. He had moved from seeing grace as permission to sin to seeing it as power to change. The same forgiveness that covered his failures also provided the motivation and strength to pursue transformation.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong>True grace doesn’t give us license to continue in sin but transforms our relationship to sin, making us people who are grieved by failure rather than comfortable with it.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Historical and Community Focus:<br>Addressing the Abuse of Grace in the Early Church</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: Romans 6:1-14 (NIV)<br></strong><em>1 What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? 2 By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? 3 Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.5 For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. 6 For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin— 7 because anyone who has died has been freed from sin’s mastery.8 Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. 9 For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. 10 The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. 11 In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. 13 Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness. 14 For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under the law but under grace.</em></p></blockquote><h4>The Historical Context of Antinomianism</h4><p>Paul’s emphatic rejection of the idea that grace encourages sin addresses a theological error that has appeared throughout church history, known as antinomianism (literally “against law”). This error takes several forms:</p><p><em><strong>Practical Antinomianism: </strong>Using grace as an excuse for continued sinful behavior, arguing that since forgiveness is guaranteed, moral effort is unnecessary.</em></p><p><em><strong>Theological Antinomianism:</strong> Teaching that God’s law has no role in the Christian life and that believers are free to live however they choose.</em></p><p><em><strong>Evangelical Antinomianism: </strong>Emphasizing justification by faith while neglecting the importance of sanctification and good works as evidence of genuine faith.</em></p><p>Paul’s response suggests that some in the Roman church were either teaching or practicing some form of antinomianism, possibly based on a misunderstanding of his teaching about grace in Romans 5:20: “But where sin increased, grace increased all the more.”</p><h4>The Logic of the Objection</h4><p><strong>The objection Paul addresses follows a certain logical progression:</strong></p><p><em><strong>Premise 1:</strong> God’s grace is magnified when it covers great sin (Romans 5:20).</em></p><p><em><strong>Premise 2: </strong>More sin would therefore result in more grace and greater glory to God.</em></p><p><em><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Christians should sin more to give God more opportunities to display his grace.</em></p><p>This logic appears sound on the surface but reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what grace actually does in the believer’s life. Paul’s response shows that grace doesn’t just cover sin—it transforms the believer’s relationship to sin.</p><h4>Paul’s Emphatic Rejection</h4><p>Paul’s response—μή γένοιτο (me genoito)—is his strongest possible rejection of an idea. He uses this phrase fourteen times in Romans, always to reject conclusions that would logically follow from his teaching if his teaching were misunderstood. The phrase could be translated as:</p><p>• “By no means!”<br>• “God forbid!”<br>• “Absolutely not!”<br>• “Perish the thought!”<br>• “Never!”</p><p>The strength of Paul’s rejection indicates that he considers this misunderstanding of grace to be not just wrong but dangerous and offensive.</p><h4>The Reality of Death to Sin</h4><p>Paul’s argument against antinomianism is based on the reality of what happens to believers in conversion. He argues that believers have “died to sin” (v. 2), which makes continued living in sin both illogical and impossible for those who truly understand their new identity.</p><p>This “death to sin” is not a gradual process but a definitive event that occurred at conversion. Paul uses aorist tenses (indicating completed action) to describe this death, emphasizing that it’s an accomplished fact rather than an ongoing process.</p><h4>The Symbolism of Baptism</h4><p>Paul uses baptism as an illustration of the believer’s union with Christ in his death and resurrection (vv. 3-4). In the early church, baptism by immersion provided a vivid picture of this spiritual reality:</p><p><em><strong>Going Under the Water: </strong>Symbolizes death and burial with Christ, representing the end of the old life dominated by sin.</em></p><p><em><strong>Coming Up from the Water:</strong> Symbolizes resurrection with Christ, representing the beginning of new life characterized by righteousness.</em></p><p>This symbolism wasn’t just ceremonial but represented a real spiritual transformation that made the believer a fundamentally different person.</p><h4>Old Testament Connection</h4><p>Paul’s concept of dying to an old way of life and being raised to a new one echoes several Old Testament themes, particularly the Exodus narrative. Just as Israel “died” to their old life of slavery in Egypt and was “raised” to new life as God’s free people, believers die to slavery to sin and are raised to freedom in Christ.</p><p>The crossing of the Red Sea, which Paul explicitly connects to baptism in 1 Corinthians 10:1-2, serves as a type of the believer’s passage from death to life. Just as the Israelites could not return to Egypt (the old life was definitively ended), believers cannot return to their former relationship with sin.</p><p>The concept also appears in Ezekiel’s vision of the valley of dry bones (Ezekiel 37), where God promises to bring his people from death to life: “I will put my Spirit in you and you will live” (Ezekiel 37:14). This resurrection imagery provides the background for Paul’s teaching about spiritual death and resurrection in Christ.</p><h4>The Union with Christ</h4><p>Central to Paul’s argument is the concept of union with Christ—believers are so closely identified with Jesus that his death and resurrection become theirs. This union has several implications:</p><p><em><strong>Shared Death:</strong> Christ’s death to sin becomes the believer’s death to sin (v. 6).</em></p><p><em><strong>Shared Resurrection:</strong> Christ’s resurrection to new life becomes the believer’s resurrection to new life (v. 4).</em></p><p><em><strong>Shared Victory:</strong> Christ’s victory over sin and death becomes the believer’s victory (v. 14).</em></p><p>This union is not just legal or positional but involves a real transformation of the believer’s nature and desires.</p><h4>The Crucifixion of the Old Self</h4><p>Paul describes the believer’s former identity as having been “crucified with him” (v. 6). The “old self” refers to the person we were before conversion—the individual whose fundamental orientation was toward sin and self rather than toward God.</p><p>This crucifixion is described as a completed event (aorist tense), not an ongoing process. The old self doesn’t need to be crucified repeatedly—it has already been definitively dealt with through union with Christ.</p><h4>Freedom from Sin’s Mastery</h4><p>The result of death to sin is freedom from sin’s mastery (v. 7). Paul uses the metaphor of slavery to describe both the believer’s former relationship to sin and their current relationship to righteousness.</p><p>This freedom doesn’t mean believers never sin, but that sin no longer has the right or power to rule over them. They may still struggle with sinful desires and occasionally fail, but they are no longer slaves who must obey sin’s commands.</p><h4>The Imperative of Identity</h4><p>Based on the reality of what God has done (the indicative), Paul issues commands about how believers should live (the imperative). The logic is: “Because you have died to sin and been raised with Christ, therefore live like it.”</p><p><em><strong>Count Yourselves Dead to Sin:</strong> Recognize and accept the reality of your new identity (v. 11).</em></p><p><em><strong>Don’t Let Sin Reign: </strong>Don’t allow sin to rule in your life as it once did (v. 12).</em></p><p><em><strong>Offer Yourselves to God: </strong>Present your bodies as instruments of righteousness rather than wickedness (v. 13).</em></p><h4>The Role of Grace</h4><p>Paul concludes by explaining that believers are “not under law but under grace” (v. 14). This doesn’t mean they are free from moral obligation but that they have a different relationship to God’s standards:</p><p><em><strong>Under Law: </strong>Trying to earn God’s favor through perfect obedience, which leads to condemnation because of failure.</em></p><p><em><strong>Under Grace: </strong>Receiving God’s favor as a gift through Christ, which leads to grateful obedience empowered by the Holy Spirit.</em></p><p>Grace doesn’t eliminate moral standards but provides both the motivation and the power to meet them.</p><h4>The Difference Between Struggle and License</h4><p>Paul’s teaching helps distinguish between legitimate struggle with sin and illegitimate use of grace as a license for sin:</p><p><em><strong>Legitimate Struggle: </strong>Believers who hate their sin, confess it when they fail, and genuinely desire to change, even when progress is slow.</em></p><p><em><strong>Illegitimate License: </strong>Using grace as an excuse to continue in sin without genuine repentance or desire for change.</em></p><p>The key difference is the believer’s fundamental orientation—toward sin or toward righteousness.</p><h4>Practical Implications for the Early Church</h4><p>Paul’s teaching had several practical implications for how the early church should understand and live out their faith:</p><p><em><strong>Baptismal Significance:</strong> Baptism wasn’t just a ceremony but a declaration of radical transformation and commitment to new life.</em></p><p><em><strong>Community Standards: </strong>The church should expect and encourage holy living among its members, not tolerate continued sinful behavior.</em></p><p><em><strong>Pastoral Care: </strong>Church leaders should help believers understand their new identity and live consistently with it.</em></p><p><em><strong>Evangelistic Message:</strong> The gospel includes both forgiveness of sin and transformation of life—it’s not just about getting to heaven but about becoming new people.</em></p><h4>Contemporary Applications</h4><p>Paul’s teaching continues to address contemporary misunderstandings of grace:</p><p><em><strong>Cheap Grace: </strong>The idea that grace costs nothing and requires no response or transformation.</em></p><p><em><strong>Therapeutic Christianity: </strong>Focusing on how faith makes us feel better while ignoring its moral demands.</em></p><p><em><strong>Cultural Accommodation:</strong> Using grace to justify conformity to cultural standards that contradict biblical values.</em></p><p><em><strong>Perfectionism: </strong>On the other hand, Paul’s teaching also addresses the opposite error of thinking that any ongoing struggle with sin indicates false faith.</em></p><h4>The Balance of Grace and Responsibility</h4><p>Paul’s teaching maintains a careful balance between divine grace and human responsibility:</p><p><em><strong>Grace Provides:</strong> Forgiveness, new identity, power for transformation, and ultimate victory over sin.</em></p><p><em><strong>Responsibility Involves: </strong>Recognizing our new identity, choosing to live consistently with it, and actively resisting sin’s influence.</em></p><p>This balance avoids both legalism (earning God’s favor through performance) and antinomianism (using grace as an excuse for continued sin).</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>How do you distinguish between struggling with sin and using grace as a license for sin in your own life?

How do we apply Paul’s teaching about grace and responsibility to our modern struggles with persistent sin? What does it mean to live “under grace” rather than “under law” when dealing with repeated failures? We’ll also see Marcus discover the difference between managing sin and being transformed by grace.</p><p><em><strong>Don’t miss Day 4: </strong>The Lesson for Me Today - when ancient truth meets modern struggle.</em></p><div><hr></div><p><em>This is Day 3 of our 6-day series “What Happens When You Repeatedly Do the Same Sin?” [<a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/what-happens-when-you-repeatedly?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">Day 1</a>] | [<a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/what-happens-when-you-repeatedly-b38?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">Day 2</a>] | Coming Tomorrow: Day 4 - The Lesson for Me Today</em></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 4: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
