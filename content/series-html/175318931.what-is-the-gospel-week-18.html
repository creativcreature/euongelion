the Son of God... a voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’” - Mark 1:1, 3</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Verse:</strong> Mark 1:1, 3 - “The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God... a voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’”</p><p><strong>Greek Word: </strong>εὐαγγέλιον (Euangelion) - “Gospel” or “Good News.” In the Roman world, this term announced great military victories or the birth of new emperors. Mark’s use suggests he believed Jesus’s arrival was the most significant news in history.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question:</strong> As I begin this investigation, how can I approach this with both critical thinking and genuine curiosity?</p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“As I begin this investigation, I’m open to examining the evidence and understanding the story being told. Help me approach this with both critical thinking and genuine curiosity.”</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Think of your favorite action movie. Does it start with a long, slow explanation of the characters’ backstories? Or does it throw you right into a car chase, a daring escape, or a tense confrontation? Many of the most compelling stories, from the opening scene of Star Wars with a massive Star Destroyer pursuing a tiny rebel ship, to the thrilling temple escape in Raiders of the Lost Ark, begin in media res—in the middle of things. This narrative technique is designed to grab the audience’s attention immediately, creating a sense of urgency and a desire to know what happens next.</p><p>This is exactly what the author of the Gospel of Mark does. He’s not interested in a leisurely stroll through the history of Jesus’s ancestors or the details of his birth. Instead, he wants his readers to feel the immediacy and importance of his message. By starting with the proclamation of John the Baptist in the wilderness—a place of testing and preparation in Jewish culture—Mark is signaling that this is not just another story. Whether you believe his claims or not, he’s presenting this as a pivotal moment in history, an event that demands attention and consideration.</p><p>The effect is intentional, designed to make us sit up and take notice. The fast-paced, action-oriented style of Mark’s Gospel is a literary device that underscores his central message: the arrival of Jesus changed everything. The story starts running from the first sentence, and we’re invited to examine where it leads. Even if we approach it with skepticism, we can appreciate the narrative craft and investigate the historical claims being made.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Mark’s urgent opening style suggests he believed this story was too important for a slow start. The narrative technique itself becomes part of the evidence for the significance he attributed to these events.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Who is Mark?</h4><p>Before we examine Mark’s account, we should ask: Who is this author, and why should we listen to him? The Gospel itself doesn’t name its author, but early church tradition consistently identifies him as John Mark, mentioned several times in the New Testament. Mark wasn’t one of the twelve apostles, but he had remarkable access to eyewitness testimony. According to early church historians like Papias (writing around 125 AD), Mark served as Peter’s interpreter and recorded Peter’s preaching about Jesus. This makes Mark’s Gospel essentially Peter’s eyewitness account, filtered through Mark’s careful documentation.</p><p>Mark also traveled with Paul and Barnabas on missionary journeys (Acts 12:25, 13:5) and was present during key moments in early church history. His mother’s house in Jerusalem served as a meeting place for the early Christians (Acts 12:12). From a historical credibility standpoint, Mark’s Gospel is considered by most scholars to be the earliest written Gospel (likely composed between 65-70 AD), making it our closest written source to the actual events.</p><h4>Old Testament Connection</h4><p>Mark immediately connects John the Baptist to two crucial Old Testament prophecies. The primary quote comes from Isaiah 40:3, written during the Babylonian exile: “A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord.’” The second quote, “I will send my messenger ahead of you,” comes from Malachi 3:1. Mark’s point is clear: this “new” story isn’t appearing in a vacuum. The wilderness setting deliberately evokes Israel’s forty years of testing. John’s appearance—camel’s hair clothing and leather belt—intentionally echoes the prophet Elijah (2 Kings 1:8). Mark is arguing that Jesus’s story is the climax of Israel’s long history with God.</p><h4>Historical and Literary Focus:<br>The Characters on Stage</h4><p><strong>Full Passage: </strong>Mark 1:1-8 (NIV)</p><p>1 The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God, 2 as it is written in Isaiah the prophet:”I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way”— 3 “a voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’”4 And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 5 The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. 6 John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. 7 And this was his message: “After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. 8 I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</p><h4>What’s Happening?</h4><p>Mark 1:1 functions as both title and thesis statement. The action begins immediately in the wilderness, a location that carried deep significance for Jewish people. The wilderness was where Israel wandered for forty years, where they were tested, and where they received the Law from God. It was a place of hardship, but also a place of new beginnings and divine encounters. By setting the opening scene here, Mark is suggesting that a new chapter in the relationship between God and humanity is about to unfold—at least, that’s his claim.</p><h4>Who’s Involved?</h4><p><strong>Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God: </strong>He is the central figure, the subject of the “good news.” Mark introduces him with two loaded titles. “Messiah” (the Greek word is Christos) means “anointed one,” referring to the long-awaited king who would deliver Israel. “Son of God” is a title of divinity—a claim that would have been both shocking and provocative to a first-century audience. From the very first verse, Mark is making it clear that he believes Jesus is no ordinary historical figure.</p><p><strong>John the Baptist:</strong> He serves as the crucial supporting character, the messenger sent to prepare the way. Mark presents John as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, quoting from both Isaiah and Malachi. His unusual appearance—a garment of camel’s hair and a leather belt—and his simple diet of locusts and wild honey are meant to evoke the image of the prophet Elijah, one of the most revered figures in Jewish history. John’s role is to be the forerunner, the herald who announces the arrival of someone greater.</p><p><strong>The People of Judea and Jerusalem: </strong>They represent the audience, the crowd drawn to John’s message. They are flocking to the wilderness, “confessing their sins and being baptized by him in the Jordan River.” This mass movement of people demonstrates the spiritual hunger and political anticipation of the time. They were longing for a word from God, and they sensed that something significant was about to happen.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>Mark’s Gospel is known for its fast pace and sense of urgency. How does this immediate, action-oriented start affect your willingness to engage with the story, regardless of your current beliefs?</p></li><li><p>John the Baptist’s role was to “prepare the way” for Jesus. What would it look like to approach this investigation with an open mind, preparing yourself to fairly examine the evidence?</p></li><li><p>The people came to John “confessing their sins.” What does intellectual honesty look like when examining historical and philosophical claims? What biases or assumptions might you need to acknowledge?</p></li></ol><h3>Share Your Thoughts</h3><p>What strikes you most about the opening scene of Mark’s Gospel? Does the sense of urgency make you more or less interested in the investigation? Share your initial thoughts and questions as we begin this journey together.</p><h3>Further Study</h3><p>For a deeper visual and scholarly overview of the Gospel of Mark, watch this short video from the BibleProject:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGHqu9-DtXk">Overview: Mark (9:17)</a></p><h3>Coming Tomorrow...</h3><p>We will explore the “connection.” How does this dramatic scene in the wilderness link to the bigger story that had been developing for centuries? We’ll examine the Old Testament prophecies that John allegedly fulfills and see how the beginning of the Gospel claims to be the continuation of a much older narrative.</p><p><em><strong>Don’t miss Day 2: </strong>The Ancient Path - when prophecy meets fulfillment.</em></p><div><hr></div><p><em>This is Day 1 of our 6-day series “What is the Gospel?” <br>[Day 1] | Coming Tomorrow: Day 2 - The Ancient Path</em></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 2: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
