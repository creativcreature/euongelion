He commands them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the promised Holy Spirit.

Fill me. Lead me. Use me.”<br>Treat that pause like your personal “upper room.”</p><p><strong>Prayer:</strong><br>“Jesus, You did not send Your disciples without power, and You are not sending me without power either. Forgive me for trying to live this life in my own strength. Teach me to wait on Your Spirit, to depend on Your power, and to see my everyday life as a place to bear witness to You.

It was filled with religious refugees from different traditions who had fled persecution and ended up living side by side on the estate of a young nobleman named Count Nicolaus von Zinzendorf. On paper, they were all Christians. In reality, the settlement was fracturing under arguments, suspicion, and quiet resentment.<a href="https://christianhistoryinstitute.org/magazine/article/ch153-remembering-revival?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Christian History Institute+1</a></p><p>Zinzendorf was deeply troubled. He had not set out to found a spiritual community, and certainly not a divided one. Instead of giving up, he began visiting homes one by one, listening to grievances, opening Scripture, and calling people to live as members of one body rather than rival factions. He urged them to take seriously Jesus’ prayer “that all of them may be one” in John 17. Slowly, some hearts began to soften.<a href="https://www.homemoravian.org/fire-on-the-earth-8-17-25/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Home Moravian Church</a></p><p>On May 12, 1727, the community gathered and entered into a covenant they called their “Brotherly Agreement” - a shared commitment to humility, mutual love, and obedience to Christ as the center of their common life. It was their way of going back to the “upper room,” laying down their personal agendas and waiting together before God. A few months later, on August 13, 1727, during a communion service, many in the congregation experienced a deep sense of God’s presence, conviction, and love all at once. Later accounts described it as their own Pentecost, a turning point when disunity gave way to a Spirit-given oneness.<a href="https://inspiretopray.com/2019/08/13/292-anniversary-of-moravian-revival-13-august-1727/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Inspire To Pray+1</a></p><p>What followed was simple but costly. A small group committed to continuous prayer, each person taking an hour, so that someone from Herrnhut would be praying every hour of every day. That “prayer watch” is widely reported to have continued, in one form or another, for about 100 years. From this once-fractured village, hundreds of missionaries eventually went out across Europe, the Caribbean, North America, Africa, and beyond. Their story did not begin with a slick strategy. It began like Acts 1 - in a place of tension and weakness, where a handful of people chose to wait together on the Holy Spirit and obey Jesus’ call.<a href="https://inspiretopray.com/2019/08/13/292-anniversary-of-moravian-revival-13-august-1727/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Inspire To Pray+1</a></p><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong><br><em>Jesus does not ask you to be impressive. He asks you to be available. The pattern in Jerusalem and in Herrnhut is the same: wait, receive power, then witness.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Dive Further (5 Minutes)</h3><p>The 40 days between Jesus’ resurrection and His ascension are easy to skim past, but they are crucial. This was not just a sentimental farewell tour. It was an intensive training window where Jesus was:</p><ul><li><p>Proving the reality of His resurrection (Acts 1:3)</p></li><li><p>Reframing the disciples’ expectations of what the Messiah would do</p></li><li><p>Reorienting them from political hopes<br>(“Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?” - Acts 1:6, NIV)<br>to a global, Spirit-powered mission (“you will be my witnesses” - Acts 1:8)</p></li></ul><p>They wanted an immediate political revolution. Jesus gave them a spiritual commission. The kingdom would not spread by swords or votes, but by witnesses filled with the Spirit, starting with a small praying community in Jerusalem and reaching to “the ends of the earth.”</p><p>If you want to see how Acts 1 fits into the big picture of the early church, you can revisit the <strong>Week 1 Master Document: The Blueprint of Community (Acts 2:42–47)</strong> as your deeper dive for this week.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/p/the-blueprint-of-community-deepdive?r=32c4cy&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Master Document&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://wokegod.substack.com/p/the-blueprint-of-community-deepdive?r=32c4cy"><span>Master Document</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>This is <strong>Day 1</strong> in our journey through Acts.<br>Coming tomorrow: <strong>Day 2 - Pentecost and the Birth of the Church (Acts 2:1–13)</strong></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 2: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
