Peter and John stand before the religious authorities and are commanded to stop speaking in the name of Jesus. Instead, they testify with clarity, courage, and joy.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Acts 4:5–31 (NIV)<br><sup>5 </sup></strong>The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and others of the high priest’s family. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: “By what power or what name did you do this?”</p><p><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers and elders of the people! <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed, <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jesus is</p><p>“‘the stone you builders rejected,<br> which has become the cornerstone.’<sup>[</sup><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4:5-31&amp;version=NIV&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com#fen-NIV-27034a"><sup>a</sup></a><sup>]</sup></p><p><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”</p><p><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say. <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>“What are we going to do with these men?” they asked. “Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign, and we cannot deny it. <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name.”</p><p><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>But Peter and John replied, “Which is right in God’s eyes: to listen to you, or to him? You be the judges! <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>As for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.”</p><p><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened. <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.</p><p><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them. <strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. “Sovereign Lord,” they said, “you made the heavens and the earth and the sea, and everything in them. <strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David:</p><p>“‘Why do the nations rage<br> and the peoples plot in vain?<br><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>The kings of the earth rise up<br> and the rulers band together<br>against the Lord<br> and against his anointed one.<sup>[</sup><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4:5-31&amp;version=NIV&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com#fen-NIV-27049b"><sup>b</sup></a><sup>]</sup>’<sup>[</sup><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4:5-31&amp;version=NIV&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com#fen-NIV-27049c"><sup>c</sup></a><sup>]</sup></p><p><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed. <strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen. <strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. <strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”</p><p><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4:5-31&amp;version=NIV&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4%3A5-31&amp;version=NIV</a></p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h3>Key Verse within the Passage (Acts 4:12)</h3><p><strong>Acts 4:12 (NIV)</strong><br>“Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”</p><p>This bold declaration sits at the center of two defining realities in Acts 3–5:</p><ul><li><p>The unstoppable power of Jesus at work through His followers.</p></li><li><p>The rising hostility of religious and political forces who want to silence Jesus’ name.</p></li></ul><p>The early church is learning what it means to be the new Temple, the new priesthood, and the new dwelling place of God. And they learn it in public, under pressure, without the safety of anonymity.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Setting the Stage: What Happens in Acts 3–5</h3><p>Acts 1–2 gave us the foundation. Acts 3–5 provide the first stress test of that foundation - the moment theory becomes practice in real-world conditions. Here is a quick overview of the story in these chapters:</p><h4>A Healing at the Temple Gate (Acts 3)</h4><div id="youtube2-Vul2TBheaZg" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Vul2TBheaZg&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vul2TBheaZg?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>Peter and John meet a man who has been lame since birth. He expects a few coins, but instead he receives a completely new life. Peter does not say, “Look at what I can do.” He says, “Look at what the risen Jesus is doing right now.”</p><p>The miracle produces:</p><ul><li><p>Personal transformation</p></li><li><p>Public astonishment</p></li><li><p>Theological confrontation</p></li><li><p>Evangelistic opportunity</p></li></ul><p>Peter’s ensuing sermon reframes the event. This healing is not random; it is a continuation of Jesus’ ministry - proof that He is alive and still acting through His people.</p><h4>Arrest and Boldness (Acts 4)</h4><div id="youtube2-VDUQb_tj_yw" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;VDUQb_tj_yw&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VDUQb_tj_yw?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>The religious leaders cannot deny the reality of the miracle, but they also cannot tolerate the message that accompanies it. Their pointed question, “By what power or what name did you do this?”, is not genuine curiosity. It is an accusation.</p><p>Peter’s answer puts Jesus at the center of everything: “It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead.” This is the moment Christianity stops being a quiet, private movement and becomes a public proclamation.</p><p>When the council orders them to stay silent, Peter and John refuse: “We cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.” The church’s response to these threats is not fear, but prayer, and God answers. The building shakes as the Spirit fills them once again, giving them more boldness instead of less.</p><h4>A Community Shaped by Generosity and Honesty (Acts 4:32–5:11)</h4><p>(See Acts 4:32–5:11 (NIV) for the full narrative:<br><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4%3A32-5%3A11&amp;version=NIV">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4%3A32-5%3A11&amp;version=NIV</a>)</p><p>The description of the early church community is radical:</p><ul><li><p>No needy persons among them</p></li><li><p>Possessions shared freely</p></li><li><p>Unity in heart and mind</p></li></ul><p>This is what happens when the Spirit renews a community’s imagination - God’s grace makes people shockingly generous and deeply unified.</p><p>But Acts 5 also shows the danger of spiritual performance. Ananias and Sapphira want the reputation of generosity without the sacrifice of it. The Holy Spirit exposes the lie quickly and dramatically.</p><p>Why such severity? Because hypocrisy, if left unchecked, rots the foundation of the church. The Spirit zealously guards the community so that its witness genuinely reflects its message.</p><h4>Signs, Growth, and Intensifying Opposition (Acts 5:12–42)</h4><div id="youtube2-nYhJWSPPpYY" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;nYhJWSPPpYY&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nYhJWSPPpYY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>The apostolic ministry explodes in impact during this time:</p><ul><li><p>Miraculous healings</p></li><li><p>Multitudes of new believers</p></li><li><p>Crowds eager to hear the gospel</p></li><li><p>Even angelic intervention to release apostles from jail</p></li></ul><p>Yet alongside this tremendous growth comes jealousy and violence from the authorities. When the apostles are hauled before the Sanhedrin again, they do not defend themselves - they defend the gospel: “We must obey God rather than human beings.”</p><p>After the council has them flogged, the apostles depart rejoicing. It is a joy that makes no sense unless one believes deeply in the worthiness of Jesus. Acts 5 concludes with this triumphant image: “Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.” In other words, pressure does not silence these disciples; it multiplies them.</p><div><hr></div><h3>The Narrative Arc of Acts 3–5</h3><p>Luke has arranged these events in a purposeful sequence. Think of it like movements in a symphony, each building on the one before it:</p><ul><li><p>Act of Power - a public healing demonstrates Jesus’ power (Acts 3).</p></li><li><p>Act of Proclamation - the apostles openly preach Jesus’ resurrection (Acts 3).</p></li><li><p>Act of Resistance - the authorities push back and arrest the apostles (Acts 4).</p></li><li><p>Act of Purification - the young community is refined through the judgment on hypocrisy (Acts 5:1–11).</p></li><li><p>Act of Perseverance - the apostles continue witnessing boldly despite escalating threats (Acts 5:12–42).</p></li></ul><p>Luke is showing us that the Spirit does not build the church by avoiding conflict, but by leading it through conflict with integrity and courage.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Historical and Cultural Context</h3><p><strong>The Temple as the Center of Public Life</strong><br>The Jewish Temple was not just a place of worship. It was the heart of Jewish identity and public life. A miracle at the Temple gate would be like a miraculous event on the steps of a modern capitol building. Everyone would see it, everyone would talk about it, and everyone would have an opinion about its meaning. By highlighting the Temple setting, Luke makes a theological point: Jesus is doing in and through the apostles what Israel’s worship was always meant to do.</p><p><strong>The Sanhedrin’s Political Vulnerability</strong><br>The opposition of the religious leaders is not driven only by theology. It is also fueled by political concerns. Rome tolerated the Jewish authorities only as long as there were no riots, no messianic uprisings, and no hint of rebellion. The sudden growth of thousands of new Jesus-followers created serious tension. The Sanhedrin feared losing control and, even more, losing Roman approval. Thus, the opposition in Acts is political, theological, social, and institutional. Beneath it all, we can sense the currents of spiritual warfare.</p><p><strong>Miracles as Signs, Not Spectacles</strong><br>The miracles in Acts are never treated as random displays of power. Each one is a sign pointing to something greater: Jesus’s ongoing authority, the arrival of God’s Kingdom, the promised renewal of Israel, and the compassionate heart of God. The apostles do not heal to impress. They heal to reveal. Every sign points back to Jesus.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Key Theological Themes</h3><p><strong>The Name of Jesus at the Center</strong><br>The early church did not spread through strategy or force of personality. It spread through allegiance to the name and authority of Jesus. His name marked every aspect of their witness. Their preaching, healing, suffering, joy, and courage were all done under Jesus’ banner. No other name had power to save, and no other name captivated their hearts like His.</p><p><strong>Spirit-Filled Boldness</strong><br>Boldness was not a personality trait. It was the byproduct of being filled with the Holy Spirit. Whenever the Spirit fills believers in Acts, the result is fearless and clear proclamation. This boldness is not about arrogance or recklessness. It is about speaking truth in love without fear. The early Christians still felt human fear, but the Spirit empowered them to move through fear into faith-fueled courage.</p><p><strong>Integrity Is Mission-Critical</strong><br>The shocking story of Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5 teaches that God cares deeply about the integrity of His people. The Spirit will not allow the young church to be built on pretense or lies. Charisma, appearances, and hype cannot transform the world, but a community of genuine, honest faith can. For the mission of the church, authenticity is essential.</p><p><strong>Suffering Forms Courage</strong><br>Instead of seeing suffering as a sign of God’s abandonment, the early church came to see it as a place where God forged greater courage and faith. When the apostles suffered for Jesus’ name, they rejoiced, not because pain is good, but because they knew they were walking in the footsteps of their Messiah. Trials and persecution actually shaped them to be bolder and more resilient, just as Jesus’ own suffering led to glory.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Linguistic Deep Dive</h3><p><strong>παρρησία (parrēsía) – “Boldness”</strong><br>This Greek term, translated as boldness or courage, literally means speaking openly. It was often used in legal settings for someone who speaks freely and frankly because they know their identity and authority. In Acts, the believers’ παρρησία is rooted in knowing they belong to Jesus.</p><p><strong>ὄνομα (onoma) – “Name”</strong><br>In the ancient world, a name carried the weight of a person’s authority, character, and reputation. To do something “in the name of Jesus” is not just invoking a label. It means acting under His authority and in alignment with His character. Thus, there truly is no other name that can save or command such loyalty.</p><p><strong>κοινωνία (koinōnía) – “Fellowship”</strong><br>This word often gets translated as fellowship or community, but it implies much more than just casual association. Koinōnía is active participation in one another’s lives, a shared life. In Acts 4, we see this deep fellowship as believers share everything and care for each other’s needs. It is a picture of a spiritual family living in a shared ecosystem of grace.</p><p><strong>ψευδολογία (pseudología) – “Falsehood”</strong><br>This term means a lie or false narrative. Ananias and Sapphira’s sin was not stinginess but ψευδολογία - creating a false image of generosity, presenting a lie as if it were true. The early church had to learn that following Jesus means living in truth, both outwardly and inwardly.</p><div><hr></div><h3>What It Meant for Them</h3><p><strong>Public Faith Required Public Courage</strong><br>For the apostles and first believers, faith in Jesus could not remain a private affair. Jesus called them to be His witnesses, a term that means testifying publicly to what one has seen and heard. They understood that following Christ meant being willing to stand up in the public square and declare the truth about Him, no matter the cost.</p><p><strong>The Holy Spirit Brought Comfort and Conviction</strong><br>The same Spirit who comforted and healed within the church also stirred up confrontation and conviction in the world. He gave the believers peace and unity, but He also provoked opposition by challenging the falsehoods and injustices of the day. In Acts, the Holy Spirit is both a gentle healer and a holy agitator, working to advance God’s kingdom on all fronts.</p><p><strong>Jesus Was Still Acting Through His People</strong><br>The miracles, sermons, and courageous stands in Acts were not ultimately the work of mere men and women. The book is often called “The Acts of the Apostles,” but it is really the acts of Jesus through the apostles by the Holy Spirit. The risen Christ remained the protagonist, continuing His mission of redemption through the hands and voices of His followers.</p><p><strong>Growth Brought Refinement</strong><br>Every time the early church grew in numbers or influence, it faced a new challenge that tested its character. Whether it was external persecution or internal deceit, each crisis forced the believers to rely even more on God. These refining moments ensured that the community’s strength came from purity of heart and dependence on the Spirit, not from human success or comfort.</p><div><hr></div><h3>What It Means for Us</h3><p><strong>Courage Grows Through Obedience</strong><br>We often assume we need to feel bold before we step out in faith. But the early church shows us that boldness often follows obedience. When we simply do the right thing or speak the truth about Jesus despite our fears, the Holy Spirit meets us in that moment. Our courage muscles grow each time we obey God rather than our anxieties.</p><p><strong>Integrity Is a Witness</strong><br>In our world, authenticity is deeply attractive because it is so rare. Living with honesty and integrity, being the same person in public that we are in private, gives credibility to our message about Jesus. The gospel rings true in the ears of others when they can see it embodied without hypocrisy. In short, integrity is a form of evangelism.</p><p><strong>Generosity Reveals What We Trust</strong><br>Just as in Acts, radical generosity today is a thermometer for our faith. It shows what is going on in our hearts. When we give freely of our time, energy, and resources, it exposes fears and breaks the power of those fears. Generosity declares that we trust God, not material security, to take care of us.</p><p><strong>Faith Is Meant to Be Visible</strong><br>Following Jesus is personal, but it is not private. A public faith does not mean being obnoxious or showy. It means our commitment to Christ permeates our lives in such a way that others can see the difference. We are called to be a city on a hill and a lamp on a stand. The early believers’ public witness, even under pressure, is an invitation for us to live a faith that can be seen and felt by the people around us.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Cross Fitness Challenge (Week 2): Practice Boldness and Integrity</h3><p>Your goal this week: Identify one area where fear has been keeping you silent about your faith, and one area where managing your image has kept you from being honest.

These chapters demonstrate that the Spirit who filled the believers in Acts 2 also sustained them through the challenges of Acts 3–5. At every turn, we see Jesus continuing His ministry, now through the hands and voices of His people.</p><p>And the story is only accelerating. Next week, opposition to the church will only grow, and yet the gospel will spread even further. We will meet the first martyr of the Christian faith and witness the dramatic conversion of the church’s greatest early persecutor.</p><p><strong>Week 3 Preview: Acts 6–9 – Stephen’s witness, the scattering of the church, and the conversion of Saul.</strong></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 1: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
