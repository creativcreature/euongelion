</strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Day 3: Acts 2:14–41 - Peter’s Sermon and the First Response</strong></h2><blockquote><h3>“Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”<br>Acts 2:38 (NIV)</h3></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1–3 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Passage:</strong><br>Acts 2:14–41 - Peter stands before the crowds in Jerusalem and declares that Jesus is both Lord and Messiah. His message cuts to the heart, leading about three thousand people to repent, be baptized, and receive the Holy Spirit.</p><p><strong>Greek Word:</strong><br><em>καρδίαν κατενύγησαν</em> (<em>kardian katenýgēsan</em>) - “they were cut to the heart.”<br>This phrase describes deep spiritual conviction - not shame, not guilt for guilt’s sake, but a piercing clarity that awakens a person to truth and draws them toward God.</p><p><strong>What’s Happening in Acts 2:14–41?</strong><br>The Spirit has filled the disciples, and now Peter stands to interpret the moment. This is the same Peter who denied Jesus weeks earlier, yet now he speaks with boldness and clarity.</p><p>He explains:</p><ul><li><p>This is the fulfillment of Joel’s prophecy</p></li><li><p>Jesus is the risen Messiah</p></li><li><p>His death was part of God’s plan</p></li><li><p>His resurrection is the final proof</p></li><li><p>His ascension places Him at God’s right hand</p></li><li><p>The Spirit’s outpouring confirms His reign</p></li></ul><p>The crowd, stunned and convicted, asks, “What shall we do?” Peter’s answer is simple and transformative:</p><ol><li><p>Repent</p></li><li><p>Be baptized</p></li><li><p>Receive the Spirit</p></li><li><p>Join the new community</p></li></ol><p>The church begins not with a strategy meeting, but with surrendered hearts and a clear gospel.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question:</strong><br>Where is God trying to “cut through” my defenses so I can repent, receive, and walk in a new direction?</p><p><strong>Urgency Moment:</strong><br>Think of one area in your life where you have been resisting conviction. Today, pray one honest sentence:<br>“Lord, make me willing to change.”<br>The Spirit meets honesty faster than perfection.</p><p><strong>Prayer:</strong><br>“Jesus, thank You for the truth that sets me free. When Your Word confronts me, help me not to run or hide. Cut through what is false in me so I can walk in what is true. Give me the courage to repent, the humility to be formed, and the joy of life in Your Spirit. Amen.”</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bqzy!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd23ca171-a0ff-45f2-9fd4-44d36085a19d_1920x1024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bqzy!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd23ca171-a0ff-45f2-9fd4-44d36085a19d_1920x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bqzy!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd23ca171-a0ff-45f2-9fd4-44d36085a19d_1920x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bqzy!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd23ca171-a0ff-45f2-9fd4-44d36085a19d_1920x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bqzy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd23ca171-a0ff-45f2-9fd4-44d36085a19d_1920x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d23ca171-a0ff-45f2-9fd4-44d36085a19d_1920x1024.jpeg" width="1456" height="777" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d23ca171-a0ff-45f2-9fd4-44d36085a19d_1920x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:777,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:472906,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/i/180296763?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd23ca171-a0ff-45f2-9fd4-44d36085a19d_1920x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bqzy!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd23ca171-a0ff-45f2-9fd4-44d36085a19d_1920x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bqzy!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd23ca171-a0ff-45f2-9fd4-44d36085a19d_1920x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bqzy!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd23ca171-a0ff-45f2-9fd4-44d36085a19d_1920x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bqzy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd23ca171-a0ff-45f2-9fd4-44d36085a19d_1920x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h2><p><em>(Part 3 of a continuing story)</em></p><p>As news of Herrnhut’s unity spread, visitors did not simply observe a peaceful community - many found themselves strangely moved by it. Some arrived ready to critique, but within hours felt something shift inside. Others came burdened by wounds from church conflicts or spiritual dryness, only to find their hearts stirred with unexpected clarity. It was not emotional manipulation. It was a calm conviction, the kind that comes when a community is so filled with prayer that people breathe in the atmosphere of God’s presence without anyone trying to force it.</p><p>One traveler from Silesia wrote in his journal that he had planned to stay only a day. Instead, he stayed three weeks. What changed him was not a sermon or argument, but the way the people of Herrnhut loved one another with patience and humility. He said their unity “laid open my heart” and exposed places he had ignored for years. Bitterness he had carried suddenly felt heavy. Habits he had justified felt hollow. He wrote, “Their life was a sermon, and my heart was pierced.”</p><p>Another visitor, a young woman from Moravia, had grown numb to faith after years of exile and religious strife. When she arrived in Herrnhut, someone invited her to a simple evening prayer gathering. As she listened to men and women pray in their own words, she felt walls she had built begin to soften. She later described it as if “the peace of God reached into the places I had locked away.” She wept quietly, not out of despair, but out of a conviction that she no longer needed to pretend.</p><p>What touched them was not flawless people or perfect behavior. It was the unmistakable sense that God was at work among ordinary believers. Herrnhut’s unity cut through defenses the way Peter’s sermon cut through hearts at Pentecost. Conviction was not an attack. It was an invitation. And those who experienced it often left different than they arrived.</p><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong><br><em>When a community lives under the Spirit’s presence, people are not pressured into change - they are invited into it. Conviction becomes a doorway to healing.</em></p><div><hr></div><h2>Dive Further (5 Minutes)</h2><p>Peter’s sermon is the first Christian sermon in history, and it sets the pattern for gospel proclamation.</p><p><strong>1. The Gospel is rooted in Scripture.</strong><br>Peter quotes Joel and Psalms to show that Jesus fulfills God’s long story. The gospel is not a new idea - it is the climax of God’s plan.</p><p><strong>2. The Gospel confronts reality.</strong><br>Peter does not soften the truth:<br>“You crucified Him.”<br>The gospel exposes sin so it can be healed, not hidden.</p><p><strong>3. The Gospel requires a response.</strong><br>The people ask, “What shall we do?” The gospel is not just information. It is an invitation to transformation.</p><p><strong>4. The Gospel creates community.</strong><br>Repentance and baptism do not lead to isolation. They lead directly into the life of the church described in Acts 2:42–47 - the blueprint we are focusing on this week.</p><p><strong>5. The Gospel opens the door for everyone.</strong><br>Peter ends with a promise:<br>“The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off - for all whom the Lord our God will call” (Acts 2:39, NIV).<br>This includes the nations, the outcasts, the outsiders, and the wanderers.</p><p>If you want to see how Acts 2:14–41 flows into the Four Pillars of Acts 2:42–47, revisit the Week 1 Master Document: The Blueprint of Community.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/the-blueprint-of-community-deepdive?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Master Document&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/the-blueprint-of-community-deepdive?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true"><span>Master Document</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>This is <strong>Day 3</strong> in our journey through Acts.<br>Coming tomorrow: <strong>Day 4 - The Four Pillars of Community (Acts 2:42–47).</strong></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 4: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
