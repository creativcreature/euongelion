wrestled with the divine tension between God’s sovereignty and our responsibility. Today, Jesus provides the ultimate resolution to that tension: the will of the Father. Jesus declares that his entire mission is to carry out the Father’s will, and that will has two parts: to lose none of those the Father has given him, and to raise them up on the last day. This shifts the foundation of our security from our own weak grip on God to his unbreakable grip on us. Our eternal destiny is not dependent on our ability to hold on, but on his commitment to never let go.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BXhI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e1f9d7-c12d-47c3-a0c2-10f8bd8683ac_1100x300.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BXhI!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e1f9d7-c12d-47c3-a0c2-10f8bd8683ac_1100x300.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BXhI!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e1f9d7-c12d-47c3-a0c2-10f8bd8683ac_1100x300.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BXhI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e1f9d7-c12d-47c3-a0c2-10f8bd8683ac_1100x300.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BXhI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e1f9d7-c12d-47c3-a0c2-10f8bd8683ac_1100x300.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/57e1f9d7-c12d-47c3-a0c2-10f8bd8683ac_1100x300.jpeg" width="1100" height="300" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/57e1f9d7-c12d-47c3-a0c2-10f8bd8683ac_1100x300.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:300,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:139447,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/i/179179562?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e1f9d7-c12d-47c3-a0c2-10f8bd8683ac_1100x300.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BXhI!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e1f9d7-c12d-47c3-a0c2-10f8bd8683ac_1100x300.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BXhI!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e1f9d7-c12d-47c3-a0c2-10f8bd8683ac_1100x300.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BXhI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e1f9d7-c12d-47c3-a0c2-10f8bd8683ac_1100x300.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BXhI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57e1f9d7-c12d-47c3-a0c2-10f8bd8683ac_1100x300.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h1>Day 5 of 6: What Will I Do?</h1><h4>“For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.” - John 6:38-39</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Passage:</strong> John 6:38-40 - “For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.”</p><p><strong>Greek Word:</strong> θέλημα (thelēma) - “will,” “desire,” “purpose.” The security of our salvation is rooted not in our will, but in God’s powerful and unchanging thelēma.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>Where am I currently placing my sense of security? In my own performance, my circumstances, or in the unchanging will of God?</p><p><strong>Urgency Moment: </strong>Stop trying to secure your own salvation. Today, consciously release your grip on the things you are trusting for security and thank God that your eternal destiny is held securely in his will.</p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“Father, thank you for your sovereign will. Thank you that my salvation is not dependent on my ability to hold on, but on your promise to never let me go. Help me to live in the confidence and freedom of that truth.”</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Liam stood by the fire pit in the backyard, the warmth of the flames pushing back the late November chill. His father came and stood beside him, holding two mugs of hot cider.</p><p>“Your mother tells me you’re a history teacher,” his father said, handing him a mug.</p><p>“That’s right,” Liam replied, surprised. He had been a history teacher for ten years, but he wasn’t sure his father had ever really taken an interest.</p><p>“I always thought that was... a waste of your potential,” his father admitted, his voice gruff. “You were smart enough to be a lawyer, like your brother.”</p><p>Liam braced himself for the familiar lecture. But it didn’t come.</p><p>“But watching you this weekend...” his father continued, staring into the fire. “You seem... content. More content than Mark, with all his success. More content than me.”</p><p>He took a sip of his cider. “This morning, I read that passage you showed me. The one about the bread of life. I kept reading. And I came to the part where Jesus talks about the will of the Father.”</p><p>He looked at Liam, his eyes searching. “He says that it’s God’s will that he should lose none of those the Father has given him. That he will raise them up on the last day.”</p><p>“That’s right,” Liam said softly.</p><p>“All my life,” his father said, his voice cracking slightly, “I’ve been trying to build something that will last. A business, a legacy, a family. I’ve been trying to hold it all together, to make sure nothing gets lost. And I’m so tired. Because things always get lost. People leave. Businesses fail. Health fades. You can’t hold on to anything.”</p><p>He looked at his hands, calloused from years of work. “But this... this says that God is the one holding on. That if you belong to him, he will not lose you. That he will raise you up. That’s a security you can’t build, can’t earn, can’t buy.”</p><p>Liam felt a lump in his throat. This was the conversation he had longed to have with his father his entire life.</p><p>“No, Dad,” he said. “You can’t. It’s a gift.”</p><p>“A gift,” his father repeated, a sense of wonder in his voice. “All this time, I’ve been trying to earn my place at the table, and he’s just... giving it away.”</p><p>They stood in silence for a long time, watching the flames dance. The gap between them, a chasm of unspoken expectations and disappointments, seemed to be closing. They were just two men, a father and a son, standing before the fire, contemplating the profound, life-altering truth of a grace that holds on and never lets go.</p><p>Liam realized that this was the true Thanksgiving. It wasn’t about the food, or the family, or the performance. It was about this. It was about standing in the warmth of God’s unwavering will, and knowing, with a deep and settled confidence, that you are secure. Not because of what you have done, but because of who is holding you.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Our eternal security is not based on the strength of our grip on God, but on the strength of his grip on us. His will is the unshakable foundation of our salvation.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Practical and Theological Focus:<br>The Unshakable Security of the Believer</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: John 6:25-40 (NIV)</strong><br><em>25 When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” 26 Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. 27 Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.” 28 Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” 29 Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.” 30 So they asked him, “What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? 31 Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” 32 Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” 34 “Sir,” they said, “always give us this bread.” 35 Then Jesus declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. 36 But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. 37 All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. 38 For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. 39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. 40 For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.”</em></p></blockquote><h4>The Mission of the Son</h4><p>In verse 38, Jesus states his mission with perfect clarity: “For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.” Jesus’s entire life and ministry were characterized by a perfect submission to the will of the Father. This is the foundation of our confidence. Our salvation is not dependent on a fallible human will, but on the perfect, unwavering obedience of the Son of God.</p><h4>The Two-Fold Will of the Father</h4><p>Jesus then defines the Father’s will in two parts, creating a divine bracket around the life of the believer that guarantees their eternal security.</p><p><strong>1. The Promise of Preservation (v. 39a): </strong>“...that I shall lose none of all those he has given me...”</p><p><em>This is a promise of divine keeping. The word for “lose” is ἀπόλλυμι (apollymi), the same word used for the “spoiling” food in verse 27. It means “to destroy” or “to let perish.” Jesus promises that he will not allow any of his true sheep to perish.</em></p><p><em>This directly addresses the fear that we might lose our salvation. Our security is not based on our ability to persevere, but on Christ’s power to preserve us.</em></p><p><strong>2. The Promise of Resurrection (v. 39b):</strong> “...but raise them up at the last day.”</p><p><em>This is the ultimate fulfillment of salvation. It is not just about being forgiven in this life, but about being given a new, glorified, resurrected body in the life to come.</em></p><p><em>The phrase “the last day” refers to the final consummation of history, when Christ returns and brings his kingdom in its fullness.</em></p><p><em>This promise anchors our hope not just in a past event (the cross) or a present reality (our relationship with Christ), but in a future certainty (our resurrection).</em></p><h4>The Will of the Father for Us (v. 40)</h4><p>In verse 40, Jesus restates the will of the Father from our perspective. It is a beautiful summary of the gospel:</p><p><strong>The Condition: </strong>“...everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him...”</p><p><em>”Looks to” (θεωρέω, theōreō) implies more than a casual glance. It is a steady, focused gaze, a contemplation that leads to belief.</em></p><p><strong>The Consequence:</strong> “...shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.”</p><p><em>Eternal life is not just something we get when we die; it is a present possession (”shall have,” present tense). It is a quality of life, a participation in the life of God, that begins the moment we believe.</em></p><p>The promise of resurrection is repeated, emphasizing the physical, bodily hope of our future salvation.</p><h4>Old Testament Connection</h4><p>The concept of God as a shepherd who keeps his flock and does not lose any of them is a powerful theme in the Old Testament.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ezekiel 34:11-12, 16: </strong><em>“For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I myself will search for my sheep and look after them. As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness... I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak...”</em></p></blockquote><p>Jesus, in John 10, will explicitly identify himself as the Good Shepherd who fulfills this promise. Here in John 6, he is making the same claim: he is the one who will seek, save, and secure the flock of God, losing none.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>How does the truth that your salvation is secured by God’s will, not your own, change the way you view your struggles, doubts, and failures?</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p>Read verse 40 again slowly.

The promise of preservation (”lose none”) or the promise of resurrection (”raise them up”)? Why?</p><div><hr></div><h2>Greek Language Learning: Week 8, Day 5</h2><h4>The Language of God’s Will and Our Security</h4><p>Today, we learn the words that form the bedrock of our eternal security.</p><p><strong>Will and Purpose:</strong><br>θέλημα (thelēma) - “will,” “desire,” “purpose”<br>βούλομαι (boulomai) - “I will,” “I wish” (a strong, deliberate will)</p><p><strong>Losing and Keeping:</strong><br>ἀπόλλυμι (apollymi) - “I lose,” “I destroy”<br>τηρέω (tēreō) - “I keep,” “I guard”</p><p><strong>Raising Up:</strong><br>ἀνίστημι (anistēmi) - “I raise up,” “I resurrect”<br>ἔσχατος (eschatos) - “last” (as in, “the last day”)</p><h4>Reading Practice</h4><p>τοῦτο δέ ἐστιν τὸ θέλημα τοῦ πέμψαντός με, ἵνα πᾶν ὃ δέδωκέν μοι μὴ ἀπολέσω ἐξ αὐτοῦ, ἀλλὰ ἀναστήσω αὐτὸ ἐν τῇ ἐσχάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ. <br>(touto de estin to thelēma tou pempsantos me, hina pan ho dedōken moi mē apolesō ex autou, alla anastēsō auto en tē eschatē hēmera.) <br>“And this is the will of the one who sent me, that all that he has given to me I should not lose of it, but should raise it up on the last day.”</p><h4>Grammar Note: The Aorist Subjunctive</h4><p>μὴ ἀπολέσω (”I should not lose”) and ἀναστήσω (”I should raise up”) are in the aorist subjunctive mood. This is often used after ἵνα (”that,” “in order that”) to express purpose. The purpose of Jesus’s mission is twofold: to not lose us and to raise us up. The aorist tense views these actions as a complete, whole event.</p><h4>Memory Tip</h4><p>Remember the two pillars of God’s will for you:</p><ol><li><p>Preservation: He will not ἀπόλλυμι (lose) you.</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p>Resurrection: He will ἀνίστημι (raise) you.</p></li></ol><h4>Practice Exercise</h4><p><strong>What is the θέλημα (will) of the Father, according to verse 39?</strong></p><ol><li><p>That Jesus should not ___ any that are given to him.</p></li><li><p>That Jesus should ___ them up on the last day.</p></li></ol><p><em>Answers: 1. lose, 2. raise</em></p><p>Tomorrow, in our final devotional, we will bring our entire 8-week journey to a close.
