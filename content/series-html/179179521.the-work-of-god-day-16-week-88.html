our final week, a week of culmination and thanksgiving. After journeying through the historical reliability of the Gospels, the identity of Jesus, the nature of belief, and the cost of discipleship, we now turn to the most personal question of all: What does this mean for me? Jesus answers this by addressing the deepest human hunger—the hunger for meaning, for purpose, for life itself. He confronts a crowd that is seeking him for the wrong reasons, and in doing so, he reveals that the work God requires of us is not a set of religious activities, but a simple, profound act of belief.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

the one he has sent.’” - John 6:29</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Passage:</strong> John 6:25-29 - “Jesus answered, ‘The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.’”</p><p><strong>Greek Word:</strong> ἔργον (ergon) - “work,” “deed,” “action.” The crowd asks about the “works” (plural) they must do, but Jesus points them to a single “work” (singular): belief.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>What “works” am I trying to do to earn God’s favor or find satisfaction, instead of simply resting in the finished work of Christ?</p><p><strong>Urgency Moment:</strong> Stop trying to earn your worth. Today, identify one area where you are striving for approval (from God or others) and consciously choose to rest in the truth that the only “work” required is to believe.</p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“God, forgive me for trying to earn what you offer freely. Help me to stop striving and to find my rest and satisfaction in the simple, profound work of believing in Jesus.”</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Liam dreaded Thanksgiving. For him, it wasn’t a day of gratitude; it was a day of performance. It was the annual family gathering where everyone implicitly compared their accomplishments from the past year. His older brother, a successful lawyer, would talk about his latest big case. His cousin would show off pictures of her new, bigger house. And Liam, a high school history teacher, would feel the familiar pressure to justify his life choices, to prove that his life was just as valuable, just as successful.</p><p>This year, the pressure felt even more intense. He had been passed over for a promotion, and his wife, Chloe, had recently decided to leave her corporate job to stay home with their young children—a decision that had put a strain on their finances. He felt like he was coming to the family feast with empty hands.</p><p>On the drive to his parents’ house, the car was quiet. Chloe could sense his anxiety. “It’s not a competition, you know,” she said gently.</p><p>“It’s easy for you to say,” Liam muttered. “You’re not the one who has to explain to my dad why we’re driving a ten-year-old car and can’t afford a real vacation.”</p><p>He was seeking something from his family—approval, validation, a sense that he measured up. He was hungry for it, and he knew that the Thanksgiving feast, with all its abundance, would not satisfy that hunger. It would only highlight what he felt he lacked.</p><p>Later that day, after the meal, Liam found himself in the quiet study, trying to escape the noise of the family gathering. He felt a deep sense of dissatisfaction, a spiritual hunger that the turkey and stuffing could not touch. He picked up an old Bible from the shelf and it fell open to the Gospel of John. His eyes landed on a passage where a crowd was following Jesus, not because of his message, but because he had miraculously fed them.</p><p>They asked Jesus, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” Liam felt a pang of recognition. That was his question. What work did he have to do to prove his worth, to feel satisfied, to be enough?</p><p>Jesus’s answer cut through the noise in his head: “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.”</p><p>It was so simple, so counterintuitive. The work was not to do more, but to believe. To trust. To rest. Liam realized he had been spending his whole life trying to perform the “works” of God—getting the right job, the right house, the right reputation. He was just like the crowd, seeking the temporary bread of human approval instead of the lasting bread of divine acceptance.</p><p>He looked out the window at his children playing in the yard, at the setting sun casting a golden glow on the autumn leaves. For the first time that day, a genuine sense of gratitude began to well up in his heart—not for his accomplishments, but for the simple, unearned gift of his family, his faith, his life. The work was not to bring a perfect life to the feast. The work was simply to believe in the one who had invited him.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Our deepest hunger is not for what we can achieve, but for what we can receive. The only “work” that truly satisfies is to stop striving and to believe in the one God has sent.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Practical and Theological Focus:<br>The Work of God vs. the Works of Man</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: John 6:25-40 (NIV)</strong><br><em>25 When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” 26 Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. 27 Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.” 28 Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” 29 Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.” 30 So they asked him, “What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? 31 Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” 32 Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” 34 “Sir,” they said, “always give us this bread.” 35 Then Jesus declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. 36 But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. 37 All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. 38 For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. 39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. 40 For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.”</em></p></blockquote><h4>The Wrong Motivation</h4><p>Jesus begins by diagnosing the crowd’s motivation. They are seeking him not because they understood the spiritual significance of his signs, but because he filled their stomachs. They were seeking physical satisfaction, not spiritual truth. Jesus calls them to shift their focus from “food that spoils” to “food that endures to eternal life.”</p><p>This is a timeless human tendency. We often pursue things that provide temporary satisfaction—wealth, success, approval, pleasure—while neglecting the deeper spiritual hunger of our souls.</p><h4>The Wrong Question</h4><p>The crowd then asks a very religious-sounding question: “What must we do to do the works God requires?” They are operating under a works-based mindset. They assume that their relationship with God is transactional—if they perform the right actions, God will reward them.</p><p>This mindset is at the heart of every religion except for true Christianity. It is the belief that we can earn our way to God through our own efforts.</p><h4>The Revolutionary Answer</h4><p>Jesus’s answer is revolutionary. He shifts their focus from the plural “works” to a singular “work”: <em>“The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.”</em></p><p><em><strong>Singular vs. Plural:</strong> The crowd is looking for a to-do list. Jesus gives them a to-be list. The focus is not on a multitude of religious activities, but on a single, all-encompassing act of faith.</em></p><p><em><strong>Belief as “Work”:</strong> Jesus uses the word “work” in an almost ironic sense. The “work” is to stop working and to trust in the finished work of another. It is to cease from our own striving and to rest in what God has done for us in Christ.</em></p><p><em><strong>The Object of Belief:</strong> The focus is not on the quality or quantity of our faith, but on the object of our faith: “the one he has sent.”</em></p><p>This is the essence of the gospel. Salvation is not achieved by our works; it is received by our faith in the work of Christ.</p><h4>Old Testament Connection</h4><p>The crowd’s works-based mindset was a misunderstanding of the Old Testament law itself. While the law contained many commands, its purpose was never to provide a means of earning salvation. Its purpose was to reveal God’s holy character and to reveal humanity’s sin and need for a savior.</p><p><strong>Habakkuk 2:4:</strong> <em>“...but the righteous will live by his faith.”</em></p><p><strong>Genesis 15:6:</strong> <em>“Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness.”</em></p><p>From the very beginning, the foundation of a right relationship with God has been faith, not works. Jesus is not introducing a new idea, but clarifying the true heart of the Old Testament law.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>What are the “spoiling foods” you find yourself working for in your own life (e.g., approval, comfort, success)?

The crowd’s purpose is to do works. Jesus redefines their purpose: to believe.</p><h4>Memory Tip</h4><p>Remember that the crowd asks about ἔργα (erga, plural), but Jesus answers with ἔργον (ergon, singular). The path to God is not a list of tasks, but a single act of trust.</p><h4>Practice Exercise</h4><p><strong>Translate the key phrases:</strong></p><ol><li><p>τὰ ἔργα τοῦ θεοῦ = ?</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p>τὸ ἔργον τοῦ θεοῦ = ?</p></li></ol><ol start="3"><li><p>πιστεύητε εἰς ὃν ἀπέστειλεν = ?</p></li></ol><p><em>Answers: 1. “the works of God,” 2. “the work of God,” 3. “you believe into the one whom he has sent”</em></p><p>Tomorrow, we will explore the crowd’s demand for a sign and Jesus’s claim to be the true bread from heaven.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Coming Tomorrow...</h3><p>The crowd challenges Jesus to prove his claims by performing a sign like the manna in the wilderness. Jesus responds by making a radical distinction between the temporary bread Moses gave and the true, life-giving bread that comes from the Father.</p><p><em><strong>Don’t miss Day 2: </strong>The True Bread from Heaven</em></p><div><hr></div><p><em>This is Day 1 of our 6-day series “The Work of God” [Day 1] | Coming Tomorrow: Day 2 - The True Bread from Heaven</em></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 2: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
