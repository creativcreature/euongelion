where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.” - John 20:25</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Verse: John 20:25 </strong>- “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”</p><p><strong>Greek Word:</strong> πιστεύω (Pisteuo) - “To believe” or “to trust.” This isn’t just intellectual agreement but active trust and commitment. In John’s Gospel, it often means “to believe into” someone, indicating relationship and dependence.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>What level of evidence do I typically require before I’m willing to trust something or someone completely?</p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“Help me to examine honestly what it means to truly believe, and give me wisdom to understand the relationship between evidence and faith.”</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Dr. Sarah Chen had built her career on skepticism. As an investigative journalist for The Washington Post, she had exposed corporate fraud, political corruption, and scientific misconduct. Her colleagues respected her because she never accepted claims at face value—she demanded documentation, cross-referenced sources, and followed the evidence wherever it led, even when it contradicted her initial assumptions.</p><p>So when her editor assigned her to investigate reports of a revolutionary new cancer treatment, Sarah approached it with her usual methodical doubt. The claims seemed too good to be true: a small biotech company claimed their experimental therapy was producing complete remissions in terminal patients. The medical establishment was skeptical, calling it “false hope” and “premature publicity.”</p><p>Sarah’s first instinct was to debunk the story. She had seen too many medical “breakthroughs” that turned out to be statistical manipulation or wishful thinking. But as she began her investigation, she encountered something unexpected: the evidence was compelling. Patient after patient showed documented, verifiable improvement. The company’s research was rigorous, their data was transparent, and independent labs were confirming their results.</p><p>The problem was that accepting this evidence would require Sarah to fundamentally change her understanding of what was possible in cancer treatment. It wasn’t just about believing new facts—it was about trusting that everything she thought she knew about the disease might be incomplete.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Sometimes the most challenging aspect of belief isn’t the lack of evidence, but the implications of accepting evidence that would require us to change our fundamental assumptions about reality.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Who is John?</h4><p>Before we examine John’s account of Thomas, we should understand who is telling this story and why we should take him seriously. The Gospel of John identifies its author as “the disciple whom Jesus loved” (John 21:20-24), and early church tradition consistently identifies this as John, one of the twelve apostles and part of Jesus’s inner circle along with Peter and James.</p><p>John was an eyewitness to the events he describes. Unlike Mark, who recorded Peter’s testimony, or Luke, who compiled accounts from multiple sources, John is writing from personal experience. He was present at the Last Supper, witnessed the crucifixion, and according to his account, was among the first to see the empty tomb.</p><p>John’s Gospel was written later than the other three (probably between 85-95 AD), which means he had decades to reflect on these events and their significance. His stated purpose is explicit: “These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name” (John 20:31). This isn’t neutral historical reporting—it’s a carefully constructed argument designed to produce faith.</p><p>From a historical credibility standpoint, John’s Gospel contains numerous details about Jewish customs, Palestinian geography, and first-century culture that have been confirmed by archaeological research. While his theological interpretation is clearly shaped by his belief in Jesus, his factual claims have proven remarkably accurate.</p><h4>Historical and Theological Focus:<br>The Anatomy of Doubt</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: John 20:24-31 (NIV)</strong><br><em>24 Now Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. 25 So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!”But he said to them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”26 A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” 27 Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.”28 Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”29 Then Jesus told him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”30 Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. 31 But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</em></p></blockquote><h4>What’s Happening?</h4><p>The scene takes place one week after Jesus’s resurrection. The disciples had already encountered the risen Jesus, but Thomas wasn’t present for that first meeting. When they tell him about it, his response is one of the most famous expressions of skepticism in history: “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”</p><p>This isn’t casual doubt—it’s methodical skepticism. Thomas isn’t saying he needs to see Jesus; he’s specifying exactly what kind of evidence would convince him. He wants to examine the wounds, to touch the scars, to verify through his own senses that this is the same person who was crucified.</p><h4>Who’s Involved?</h4><p><strong>Thomas (Didymus): </strong>His name means “twin,” and he appears several times in John’s Gospel as someone who asks direct, sometimes challenging questions. He’s not portrayed as particularly faithless—earlier in John’s Gospel, when Jesus decided to return to Judea despite danger, Thomas said, “Let us also go, that we may die with him” (John 11:16). He’s loyal but realistic, committed but cautious.</p><p><strong>The Other Disciples: </strong>They serve as witnesses to the resurrection, but their testimony isn’t enough for Thomas. This creates an interesting dynamic: the people closest to Thomas, people he trusts and respects, are making an extraordinary claim that he can’t accept based on their word alone.</p><p><strong>Jesus: </strong>He appears again, specifically to address Thomas’s doubt. Remarkably, he doesn’t rebuke Thomas for his skepticism but offers exactly the evidence Thomas requested. This suggests that Jesus takes honest doubt seriously and is willing to provide evidence to those who genuinely seek it.</p><h4>The Nature of Thomas’s Doubt</h4><p>Thomas’s skepticism is often criticized, but it’s actually quite reasonable. He had seen Jesus die—crucifixion was a public, brutal form of execution designed to ensure death. Claims of resurrection would naturally require extraordinary evidence. Thomas wasn’t being stubborn; he was being careful.</p><p>What’s interesting is that Thomas’s doubt is specific and testable. He doesn’t say, “I’ll never believe” or “That’s impossible.” He says, “Here’s exactly what it would take to convince me.” This is the kind of doubt that can lead to stronger faith because it’s honest about what it would take to overcome reasonable skepticism.</p><h4>The Question of Evidence and Faith</h4><p>John’s account raises important questions about the relationship between evidence and faith. Thomas receives the evidence he requested, but Jesus also speaks of those who “have not seen and yet have believed.” This suggests that while evidence can support faith, faith ultimately involves trust that goes beyond what can be empirically verified.</p><p>This doesn’t mean faith is irrational or that evidence is irrelevant. Rather, it suggests that faith involves a different kind of knowing—one that includes but transcends purely empirical verification. Thomas’s experience becomes a bridge for readers who, like us, cannot physically examine Jesus’s wounds but must decide whether the testimony of those who did is credible.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>How do you typically respond to claims that seem too good to be true?

Each letter has a name, a sound, and often appears in English words you already know.</p><p>Α α - Alpha (AL-fah) - sounds like “a” in “father”<br>English connection: alphabet, alpha male<br><br>Β β - Beta (BAY-tah) - sounds like “b” in “boy”<br>English connection: beta test, beta version</p><p>Γ γ - Gamma (GAM-ah) - sounds like “g” in “go”<br>English connection: gamma rays</p><p>Δ δ - Delta (DEL-tah) - sounds like “d” in “dog”<br>English connection: delta (river mouth), Delta Airlines</p><p>Ε ε - Epsilon (EP-si-lon) - sounds like “e” in “pet”<br>English connection: used in mathematics</p><p>Ζ ζ - Zeta (ZAY-tah) - sounds like “z” in “zoo”<br>English connection: zeta function in math</p><p>Η η - Eta (AY-tah) - sounds like “ay” in “day”<br>English connection: ETA (estimated time of arrival)</p><p>Θ θ - Theta (THAY-tah) - sounds like “th” in “think”<br>English connection: theta waves in brain research</p><h4>Practice with Today’s Key Word</h4><p>Our key word today is πιστεύω (pisteuo) - “to believe”<br><strong>Let’s identify the letters:</strong><br>•π (pi) - “p” sound<br>•ι (iota) - “i” sound<br>•σ (sigma) - “s” sound<br>•τ (tau) - “t” sound<br>•ε (epsilon) - “e” sound<br>•υ (upsilon) - “u” sound<br>•ω (omega) - “o” sound</p><p><strong>Practice: </strong>Write out the Greek letters for πιστεύω three times, saying each letter name as you write it.</p><h4>Memory Tip</h4><p><strong>Remember: </strong>Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta - the first four letters follow the same pattern as A, B, C, D in English!</p><h4>Tomorrows Lesson...</h4><p>We’ll learn the next eight letters of the alphabet and start recognizing more words from our Gospel passages. We’ll also see how the word πιστεύω appears in tomorrow’s text about evidence and belief.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Coming Tomorrow...</h3><p>We’ll explore how Jesus responds to Thomas’s demand for evidence. Does he provide the proof Thomas requested, or does he challenge the very premise of his skepticism? We’ll also continue Sarah Chen’s investigation as she grapples with evidence that challenges her assumptions.</p><p><em><strong>Don’t miss Day 2:</strong> The Evidence Provided - when proof meets faith.</em></p><div><hr></div><p><em>This is Day 1 of our 6-day series “What Does it Mean to Believe?” [Day 1] | Coming Tomorrow: Day 2 - The Evidence Provided</em></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 2: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
