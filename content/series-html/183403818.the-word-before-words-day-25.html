After the catastrophic collapse of the San José mine in Chile on August 5, 2010, the 33 men trapped inside were utterly cut off. They were half a mile underground, in a darkness so absolute it was a physical weight. Above ground, their families and the rescue teams worked frantically, drilling one exploratory borehole after another into the unstable mountain, but with no success. The world held its breath, fearing the worst. The mine had become a tomb, a modern <em>tohu va-vohu</em>, a formless, empty void where hope itself seemed to have been buried.</p><p>Down below, the 33 men were surviving on rations designed to last two days. They had organized themselves, with their shift foreman, Luis Urzúa, acting as their leader. They conserved their food, rationed their battery power, and prayed. But as the days stretched on with no word from the surface, despair began to set in. They were living in a world without light, without sound from the outside, without any sign that they had not been forgotten. They were utterly alone in the deep.</p><p>On August 22nd, the seventeenth day, the miners heard a sound—the distant grinding of a drill bit. They scrambled to make their presence known, banging on the drill with tools. When the drill was pulled back to the surface, the rescue workers found a plastic bag tied to the end. Inside was a note, scrawled in red marker: “<em>Estamos bien en el refugio los 33.</em>” (“We are well in the shelter, the 33 of us.”) The note was a miracle. It was the first word from the void, the first sign of life from the tomb. It was not a rescue plan. It was not a map. It was light. And in that moment, the entire world celebrated, not because the men were saved, but because they were alive. The light had broken through the darkness.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway: The first act of salvation is not a plan, but the arrival of light in our darkness.</strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h2>Go Deeper</h2><h4>Scripture Reading</h4><p><strong>Genesis 1:3–5 (NIV)</strong></p><blockquote><p>3 And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4 God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.</p></blockquote><p><strong>John 1:3–5 (NIV)</strong></p><blockquote><p>3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4 In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h4>What’s Happening in the Text?</h4><p>God’s first speech is a command: “Let there be light.” The Hebrew is <em>yehi ‘or</em> (יְהִי אוֹר). It is not a request, but a royal decree. The result is immediate: “and there was light.” God’s word does not describe reality; it creates it.</p><p>Notice what God does next. He sees that the light is “good.” This is the first divine evaluation in Scripture. Light aligns perfectly with God’s character and purpose. Then, He “separates” the light from the darkness, establishing the rhythm of day and night. This act of separation is key to creation; God brings order out of chaos by making distinctions.</p><p>John reveals the source of this light. It is not an impersonal energy, but the very “life” that is in the Word—Jesus Christ. The light that flooded the cosmos on Day 1 is the same light that walked among us in human flesh. John 1:3 tells us that “through him all things were made.” This means Jesus was not just present at creation; He was the active agent. When God said “Let there be light,” it was the Word—the <em>Logos</em>—who spoke it into being.</p><p>And this light has a unique quality: the darkness cannot “overcome” it (<em>katalambanō</em>). The battle was over before it began. Just as the note from the Chilean miners broke through the darkness of uncertainty, Jesus breaks through the darkness of sin and death. John 8:12 records Jesus saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” The light is not just a force; it is a Person.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Key Word or Concept</h2><p><em><strong>Katalambanō</strong></em><strong> (καταλαμβάνω)</strong> — the Greek word in John 1:5 translated as “overcome.”</p><p>This word has a powerful double meaning. It can mean “to overpower” or “to conquer,” as in a battle. But it can also mean “to grasp” or “to comprehend.”</p><p>Both meanings are true here. The darkness cannot extinguish the light, but it also cannot understand it. The logic of darkness—of sin, death, and despair—has no category for the logic of light—of grace, life, and hope. The darkness can neither defeat the light nor figure it out.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Community Reflection</h2><p><em>If you’re willing, share in the comments:</em></p><blockquote><p>When has a moment of unexpected hope felt like a light appearing in your darkness?</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>This Week’s Journey</h2><p><strong>This is Day 2 of 5.</strong></p><p>Yesterday, we acknowledged the presence that exists before the promise. Today, we witnessed the arrival of light.</p><p>Tomorrow, we will explore what happens when God begins to bring order to the chaos, separating the waters and creating a space for life to flourish.</p><p><strong>Below is a link to the study guide document, with a more detailed dive into the scripture. </strong></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/the-word-before-words-week-1-deep?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Deep Dive&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/the-word-before-words-week-1-deep?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true"><span>Deep Dive</span></a></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 3: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
