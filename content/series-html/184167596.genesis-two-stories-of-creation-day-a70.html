Emily was born healthy, but Jamie was delivered limp and silent. For twenty minutes, doctors worked to revive him, but he showed no signs of life. They pronounced him dead and handed his small, lifeless body to his mother so she could say goodbye. Kate took her son and laid him on her bare chest, a practice known as “kangaroo care.” She and her husband, David, spoke to him, told him his name, and poured out their love for the son they had just lost.</p><p>For two hours, Kate held her son, skin-to-skin, her warmth enveloping his cold body. She held him not to revive him, but simply to be with him, to love him in his final moments. But then, something miraculous happened. The baby began to gasp. The doctor dismissed it as a reflex, but Kate felt the life in him. She held him closer, and he began to breathe. Slowly, miraculously, Jamie came back to life, his breath returning, his color changing from gray to pink. The doctors were stunned. The baby they had declared dead was now alive and well, resting in the warmth of his mother’s embrace.</p><p>This is a modern-day picture of Genesis 2:7. We are born spiritually lifeless, separated from God. But He does not abandon us. He draws near, holds us close, and breathes His own life into us. The story of Jamie Ogg is a testament to the power of presence, of warmth, of a love that refuses to let go. It is a beautiful illustration of the God who kneels in the dust, holds us in His arms, and breathes His own Spirit into our lungs, turning what was lifeless into a living soul.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway: Our spiritual life is not our own achievement; it is the result of God’s intimate, life-giving breath.</strong></em></p><h2>Go Deeper</h2><h3>Scripture Reading</h3><p>Genesis 2:7 (NIV)</p><blockquote><p>7 Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.</p></blockquote><p>John 20:22 (ESV)</p><blockquote><p>22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.”</p></blockquote><h3>What’s Happening in the Text?</h3><p>Genesis 2:7 gives us the close-up of creation. Yahweh Elohim acts as a potter, forming (yatsar) a man from the dust. This emphasizes our humble origins. But then, He does something extraordinary. He breathes into the man’s nostrils the “breath of life” (neshamah). This is more than just air; it is the divine spark, the spirit, the very life-force of God. This is what makes humanity unique.</p><p>John 20:22 is the new creation equivalent of this moment. After His resurrection, Jesus appears to His disciples, who are hiding in fear. He has conquered sin and death, and now He comes to give them new life. He “breathed on them” and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.” This is a direct echo of Genesis 2:7. The same God who breathed life into Adam is now breathing new, spiritual life into His followers. This is the birth of the Church, the beginning of the new creation.</p><h3>Key Word or Concept</h3><p>Neshamah (נְשָׁמָה) — Breath / Spirit</p><p>This Hebrew word is one of several words for “spirit” in the Old Testament, but it is the one most closely associated with the life-giving breath of God. It is the spark of conscious, intelligent, spiritual life that God imparts to humanity. It is what makes us capable of relationship with Him.</p><p>When Jesus breathes on His disciples in John 20, He is restoring the neshamah that was lost in the Fall. He is giving them the Holy Spirit, the very presence and power of God, to live within them. This is the promise of the new covenant: not just a law written on stone, but a new heart and a new spirit put within us (Ezekiel 36:26).</p><h3>Community Reflection</h3><p>If you’re willing, share in the comments:</p><p>When have you felt the “breath of God” in your own life? It could be a moment of sudden clarity, a feeling of peace in the midst of a storm, or a renewed sense of purpose. How did that experience change you?</p><h3>This Week’s Journey</h3><p><strong>This is Day 3 of 5.</strong></p><p>Today, we have seen the intimate, life-giving nature of our Creator. We are dust, but we are dust animated by the very breath of God.</p><p>Tomorrow, we will explore what happens when that breath is used to speak, and the power of the words we use.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/genesis-two-stories-of-creation-deep?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Genesis Deep Dive&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/genesis-two-stories-of-creation-deep?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true"><span>Genesis Deep Dive</span></a></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 4: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
