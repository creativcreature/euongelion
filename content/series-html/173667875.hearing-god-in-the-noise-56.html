MY FEELINGS</h1><h2>"The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?" - Jeremiah 17:9</h2><div><hr></div><h3>1-MINUTE IMMERSION</h3><p><strong>Hebrew Word:</strong> לֵב (lev) - heart, inner self (mind, will, emotions)</p><p><strong>Pronunciation:</strong> LAYV</p><p><strong>Verse:</strong> "The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?" - Jeremiah 17:9 (NIV)</p><p><strong>Question: </strong>When you sense a leading or desire, how can you tell if it's God's voice guiding you or just your own emotions and wants?</p><p><strong>Prayer:</strong> Father, search my lev - my heart. I acknowledge that my feelings can mislead me. Purify my motives and sharpen my discernment. I submit my desires to Your Word and Spirit. Let Your voice be louder than my own inner voice. Amen.</p><div><hr></div><h3>5-MINUTE IMMERSION</h3><h4>The Modern Disciple's Confusion</h4><p>Daniel had an important life choice to make: whether to take a stable job in his hometown or move overseas for a missionary opportunity. His excitement soared at the idea of adventure abroad. He prayed, "God, I feel so strongly that You want me to go!"</p><p>Weeks later, however, the overseas position fell through due to unforeseen issues. Daniel was crushed. "But God, I felt You leading me!" he lamented.</p><p>In the aftermath, a mentor gently challenged him: Had God clearly said to go, or had Daniel assumed his strong feelings were God's voice? Daniel decided to slow down and seek God afresh - spending extra time in Scripture, fasting, and asking for wise counsel.</p><p>Over time, a different picture emerged: he noticed in prayer a recurring sense of peace about staying and serving in his own community first. It wasn't as glamorous as his original plan, but it aligned with a Bible principle that kept coming to mind: "Whoever can be trusted with little can also be trusted with much" (Luke 16:10).</p><h3>The Ancient Warning: The Deceitful Heart</h3><p>Our emotions are a God-given part of us, but Scripture warns that the heart (our inner feelings and desires) can be "deceitful above all things." That doesn't mean our feelings are always wrong; it means they're not a reliable stand-alone guide.</p><p>Think of Peter, who felt sure he would never abandon Jesus, but later that very night he denied Him three times. Peter's emotional confidence wasn't the same as God's reality. Or consider Saul (later Paul) - he felt he was serving God by persecuting Christians, until Jesus appeared and corrected him.</p><p><strong>So how do we discern between God's voice and our own inner voice?</strong></p><p><em><strong>First:</strong> God's voice aligns with Scripture's unchanging truth, whereas our feelings often fluctuate.</em></p><p><em><strong>Second: </strong>God's voice brings a wisdom and peace that transcends momentary emotion. Colossians 3:15 says "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts."</em></p><p><em><strong>Third: </strong>Seek wise counsel. Proverbs 11:14 notes that "in an abundance of counselors there is safety."</em></p><p><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>Can you recall a time you followed a feeling you thought was God, and it turned out not to be? What did you learn from that?</p><p><strong>Today's Commitment: </strong>Today, when I experience a strong emotion or urge to act, I will pause and pray: "Lord, is this from You, or just from me?" I will wait and, if possible, seek confirmation from Scripture before jumping forward.</p><h2>15-MINUTE IMMERSION</h2><h3>Hebrew Deep Dive: Understanding Lev</h3><p><strong>English Verse:</strong> "The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?" - Jeremiah 17:9 (NIV)</p><p><strong>Hebrew Text:</strong> עָקֹב הַלֵּב מִכֹּל וְאָנֻשׁ הוּא מִי יֵדָעֶנּוּ</p><p><strong>Transliteration:</strong> Aqov halev mikol ve'anush hu mi yeda'enu</p><p><strong>Word-by-Word: </strong><br>• עָקֹב (aqov) = deceitful, crooked, twisted <br>• הַלֵּב (halev) = the heart <br>• מִכֹּל (mikol) = above all, more than all <br>• וְאָנֻשׁ (ve'anush) = and incurable, desperately sick <br>• הוּא (hu) = it <br>• מִי (mi) = who <br>• יֵדָעֶנּוּ (yeda'enu) = can know it, understand it</p><p>In Hebrew thought, the lev (heart) was not just the seat of emotion; it referred to one's inner life - thoughts, will, and affections. Jeremiah 17:9's sobering statement that the heart is deceitful (literally "crooked") comes in a context: the prior verses contrast the person who trusts in human strength versus the person who trusts in the Lord.</p><h3>The Contemporary Challenge: Emotional Decision-Making</h3><p>Sarah was known for her "gut instincts" in business. She prided herself on making quick decisions based on how things "felt." This approach had served her well professionally, so she applied it to her spiritual life too.</p><p>But when Sarah's feelings led her to make several poor relational choices - each time convinced "God was leading" - she began to question her discernment. A wise mentor helped her see that while emotions are important, they need to be submitted to Scripture and wise counsel.</p><p>Sarah learned to ask three questions before acting on strong feelings: "Does this align with Scripture?" "Do wise counselors agree?" and "Does this bring lasting peace or just temporary excitement?"</p><h3>Biblical Parallel: Jesus in Gethsemane</h3><p>The supreme example is Jesus in Gethsemane. He confessed, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death." He felt intense distress at the prospect of the cross. He even prayed, "Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me." Yet, He immediately followed with, "Yet not My will, but Yours be done" (Luke 22:42).</p><p>Jesus shows us the model: honestly acknowledge your feelings to God, but ultimately submit them to His will. In doing so, He discerned the Father's voice - to go to the cross - over the human desire to avoid pain.</p><h3>Historical Context: Ancient Wisdom on the Heart</h3><p>The ancient world understood the heart's complexity. Egyptian wisdom literature warned against trusting emotions alone. Greek philosophers like Aristotle distinguished between different types of desires and the need for reason to guide emotion.</p><p>The Hebrew Scriptures go deeper, recognizing that the heart's corruption affects not just emotions but thoughts and will. This is why Psalm 139:23-24 prays, "Search me, O God, and know my heart... See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."</p><p>The solution isn't to ignore emotions but to submit them to God's searching and Scripture's truth.</p><h3>Fascinating Factoid</h3><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong> Martin Luther once wrote: "Feelings come and feelings go, And feelings are deceiving: My warrant is the Word of God, Naught else is worth believing." It's a reminder that while emotions have their place, God's Word is the final authority over what we think we're "hearing."</p><h3>The Cross Commitment</h3><p><strong>What I'm Leaving at the Cross Today:</strong> My insistence on having my own way, which can masquerade as "God told me so." The confusion and instability caused by following every emotional whim. Any bitterness toward God for times He didn't "rubber-stamp" my plans.</p><p><strong>What I'm Receiving from the Cross Today:</strong> A new openness to God's true voice, even if it gently corrects or redirects me. Greater self-awareness about my emotions, submitted to Christ. The assurance that God's will - though not always what I initially want - is always loving and ultimately best for me and others.</p><h2>Community Discussion</h2><h3>For Reflection:</h3><p>• Why do you think God sometimes says "no" or "wait" to us, even when we feel so sure about a direction? Have you experienced His loving redirection? <br>• How can distinguishing between God's voice and your own impulses improve your decision-making and spiritual growth? <br>• Share a practice that helps you discern God's guidance (searching the Scriptures, journaling prayers, seeking confirmation).</p><h3>For Accountability Partners:</h3><p>• Be honest with each other about something you strongly feel led to do. Help each other test that leading with questions: Does it align with Scripture? Does it bring peace or anxiety? What do wise counselors say? <br>• Pray together about major decisions you're facing, asking God to reveal any areas where emotions might be clouding His voice. <br>• Check in weekly: "What's one way you distinguished between God's voice and your feelings this week?"</p><h2>Share Your Thoughts</h2><p><strong>What's one desire or fear in your heart right now that could be "clouding" what you hear from God?</strong> Sometimes naming it is the first step to surrendering it.</p><p><strong>Discernment Check:</strong> What's one tool you use to test whether an inner voice is from God or from your emotions? Share your wisdom!</p><h2>Coming Tomorrow...</h2><p>How do you build a lifestyle of hearing God, not just occasional moments? Tomorrow we'll conclude our journey by exploring daily rhythms that keep us tuned to God's voice amid life's noise.</p><p><em><strong>Don't miss Day 6:</strong> Building rhythms of grace.</em></p><div><hr></div><p><em>This is Day 5 of our 6-day series "Hearing God in the Noise."
