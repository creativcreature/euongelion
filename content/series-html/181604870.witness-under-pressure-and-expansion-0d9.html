Believers are scattered beyond Jerusalem. Instead of silencing the gospel, the scattering multiplies it. Philip brings the good news to Samaria and then to an Ethiopian official on a desert road.</p><p><strong>Greek Word:</strong><br><strong>διασπείρω (diaspeírō)</strong> — “to scatter seed.”<br>This word was commonly used for sowing grain. Luke intentionally uses it to show that persecution does not destroy the church. It plants it.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>The Scripture: Acts 8:1–40 (NIV)</strong></h2><blockquote><p><em><strong>Acts 8:1–4</strong><br>On that day a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.<br>But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison.<br>Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.</em></p><p><em><strong>Acts 8:5–8</strong><br>Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah there. When the crowds heard Philip and saw the signs he performed, they all paid close attention to what he said. For with shrieks, impure spirits came out of many, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. So there was great joy in that city.</em></p><p><em><strong>Acts 8:26–31</strong><br>Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Go south to the road—the desert road—that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.”<br>So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of the Kandake, which means “queen of the Ethiopians.” This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship, and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the Book of Isaiah the prophet.<br>The Spirit told Philip, “Go to that chariot and stay near it.”<br>Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. “Do you understand what you are reading?” Philip asked.<br>“How can I,” he said, “unless someone explains it to me?” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</em></p><p><em><strong>Acts 8:35–38</strong><br>Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.<br>As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?”<br>And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.</em></p><p><em><strong>Acts 8:39–40</strong><br>When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.<br>Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.</em></p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2><strong>What’s Happening in Acts 8?</strong></h2><p>Stephen’s death marks a turning point.</p><p>Jerusalem is no longer safe.<br>The church is forced outward.<br>What looks like loss becomes expansion.</p><p>Acts 8 shows two movements happening at the same time:</p><p>Wide scattering — believers carry the gospel into new regions.<br>Deep personalization — God pursues a single searching soul on a desert road.</p><p>Philip’s ministry reminds us that mission is not only about crowds.<br>It is also about one conversation, one question, one obedient step.</p><p>The Spirit is not reacting to persecution.<br>He is directing the spread.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Reflection Question</strong></h2><p>Where might God be using disruption or discomfort in my life to move the gospel through me into places it has not gone before?</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Urgency Moment</strong></h2><p>Ask this today:</p><p>“Holy Spirit, where are You already at work that I am being invited to join?”</p><p>Pay attention to interruptions, detours, and quiet nudges.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Prayer</strong></h2><p>“Lord Jesus, forgive me when I cling to comfort and resist change. Teach me to trust that You are at work even in disruption. Use my obedience, wherever You scatter me, to bring joy and life to others. Amen.”</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Story Time (5 Minutes)</strong></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r-Wm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc4ee06-9725-40c1-9dea-ec599d070e21_1920x1024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r-Wm!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc4ee06-9725-40c1-9dea-ec599d070e21_1920x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r-Wm!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc4ee06-9725-40c1-9dea-ec599d070e21_1920x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r-Wm!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc4ee06-9725-40c1-9dea-ec599d070e21_1920x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r-Wm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc4ee06-9725-40c1-9dea-ec599d070e21_1920x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dcc4ee06-9725-40c1-9dea-ec599d070e21_1920x1024.jpeg" width="1456" height="777" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dcc4ee06-9725-40c1-9dea-ec599d070e21_1920x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:777,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:810286,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/i/181604870?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc4ee06-9725-40c1-9dea-ec599d070e21_1920x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r-Wm!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc4ee06-9725-40c1-9dea-ec599d070e21_1920x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r-Wm!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc4ee06-9725-40c1-9dea-ec599d070e21_1920x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r-Wm!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc4ee06-9725-40c1-9dea-ec599d070e21_1920x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r-Wm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc4ee06-9725-40c1-9dea-ec599d070e21_1920x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Part 3 of a 5-Day True Story: Scattering Creates Seeds</strong></p><p>After leaving the hostile monastery, Benedict did not return to isolation. Instead, he did something unexpected.</p><p>He began to gather others.</p><p>Small communities formed around him in the hills of Subiaco. Twelve monasteries emerged, each with twelve monks. No grand vision statement. No centralized power. Just shared life, prayer, labor, and obedience.</p><p>This was not accidental.</p><p>Benedict had learned that concentration of power breeds corruption. Multiplication creates resilience.</p><p>Each community was self-sustaining. Each practiced stability, humility, and mutual responsibility. Each was shaped by rhythm rather than charisma.</p><p>Rome continued to decay. Political authority fractured. Violence crept closer. But in scattered places across the countryside, something steady took root.</p><p>Years later, Benedict would move south to Monte Cassino, where he would write what became known as <em>The Rule of St. Benedict</em>. It was not revolutionary. That was its strength.</p><p>Pray regularly.<br>Work honestly.<br>Submit to one another.<br>Welcome the stranger.<br>Stay when things get hard.</p><p>While empires collapsed, Benedict’s communities endured. They preserved Scripture. Educated children. Fed the poor. Offered refuge to travelers. The gospel spread quietly, monastery by monastery, long after Rome fell.</p><p>Like the believers scattered in Acts 8, Benedict never planned to change the world.</p><p>He simply obeyed where he was sent.</p><p>And the scattering became the seed.</p><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong><br>God’s work is not stopped by displacement. It is often accelerated by it. Faithfulness, repeated in small places, can outlast empires.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Dive Further (5 Minutes)</strong></h2><p>Acts 8 reshapes how we think about disruption.</p><p><strong>1. Persecution becomes propulsion.</strong><br>The gospel moves outward because believers are forced outward.</p><p><strong>2. Samaria matters.</strong><br>This fulfills Jesus’ promise in Acts 1:8. Old ethnic and religious barriers are crossed.</p><p><strong>3. God sees individuals in the margins.</strong><br>The Ethiopian eunuch is powerful yet excluded. God meets him personally.</p><p><strong>4. Scripture opens through relationship.</strong><br>Philip does not start with answers. He starts with listening and explanation.</p><p>If you want to see how scattering fits into the broader movement of Acts 6–12, return to the <strong>Week 4 Master Document</strong> for the full narrative arc.</p><p>Tomorrow, the story takes a shocking turn — the persecutor meets Jesus Himself.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/witness-under-pressure-and-expansion?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Master Document&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/witness-under-pressure-and-expansion?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true"><span>Master Document</span></a></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 4: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
