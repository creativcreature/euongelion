no one will snatch them from my hand.” - John 10:28</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Verse: </strong>John 10:28 - “I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them from my hand.”</p><p><strong>Greek Word:</strong> ἁρπάζω (Harpazo) - “To snatch” or “to seize by force.” This is the word used for violent robbery or kidnapping. Jesus is saying that no external force can violently tear his sheep away from him.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question:</strong> What does it mean that Jesus gives eternal life as a present reality, not just a future hope?</p><p><strong>Urgency Moment:</strong> Right now, identify one area where you’re living as if your relationship with God depends on your performance rather than his promise. Stop trying to earn what you already have.</p><p><strong>Prayer: </strong>“Help me understand the security I have in Christ while also taking seriously my responsibility to live faithfully as his follower.”</p><div><hr></div><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Dr. Sarah Martinez had been a pediatric oncologist for fifteen years when she began to question everything she thought she knew about faith, doubt, and perseverance. It started with a patient—eight-year-old Emma, who had been battling leukemia for two years. Emma’s parents were devout Christians who had prayed fervently for healing, organized prayer chains, and maintained unwavering faith that God would cure their daughter.</p><p>When Emma’s condition worsened despite aggressive treatment, her father, Pastor David Chen, began to struggle with doubt in ways he had never experienced. “Dr. Martinez,” he said during one of their conversations, “I’ve preached for twenty years that God is faithful, that he answers prayer, that faith can move mountains. But watching my daughter suffer... I’m starting to wonder if I ever really believed at all.”</p><p>Sarah had seen this crisis many times before—faithful people whose trust in God was shaken by tragedy. But Pastor Chen’s struggle was different. He wasn’t just questioning God’s goodness or power; he was questioning the authenticity of his own faith. “If I was really saved, would I be having these doubts?” he asked. “Does questioning God mean I was never truly a believer in the first place?”</p><p>The question haunted Sarah because she had wrestled with similar doubts throughout her career. Every child she couldn’t save, every prayer that seemed unanswered, every moment when her faith felt more like wishful thinking than confident trust—did these experiences mean her salvation was in jeopardy? Or was doubt somehow compatible with genuine faith?</p><p>As she watched Pastor Chen navigate his crisis of faith while continuing to love his daughter, serve his congregation, and seek God despite his questions, Sarah began to wonder: What does it really mean to be “saved”? Is it a one-time decision that guarantees eternal security regardless of subsequent doubts or failures? Or is it an ongoing relationship that requires constant maintenance and can be lost through insufficient faith or persistent sin?</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The relationship between faith, doubt, and eternal security is more complex than simple formulas suggest, and real-life crises often force us to examine what we actually believe about salvation.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Textual and Theological Focus:<br>Jesus’s Promise of Eternal Security</h4><blockquote><p><em><strong>Full Passage: John 10:25-30 (NIV)</strong><br>25 Jesus answered, “I did tell you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father’s name testify about me, 26 but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. 27 My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. 28 I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them from my hand. 29 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them from my Father’s hand. 30 I and the Father are one.”</em></p></blockquote><h4>Who is John?</h4><p>Before examining this crucial passage about eternal security, we should understand who wrote it and why we should trust his account. The Gospel of John was written by John the Apostle, one of Jesus’s closest disciples and part of his inner circle along with Peter and James.</p><p>John was an eyewitness to the events he records, and his Gospel is written from the perspective of someone who had intimate, personal knowledge of Jesus. He refers to himself as “the disciple whom Jesus loved” (John 13:23, 19:26, 20:2, 21:7, 21:20), indicating a particularly close relationship with Jesus.</p><p>From a historical credibility standpoint, John’s Gospel provides unique insights into Jesus’s private conversations and teachings that aren’t found in the other Gospels. John explicitly states his purpose in writing: “These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name” (John 20:31). This makes his testimony about eternal security particularly significant—he’s writing specifically to help people understand what it means to have eternal life through faith in Jesus.</p><h4>The Context of Jesus’s Promise</h4><p>Jesus’s statement about eternal security comes in response to a direct challenge from Jewish religious leaders who demanded that he tell them plainly whether he was the Messiah (John 10:24). His response reveals several crucial truths about salvation and security:</p><p>The Nature of His Sheep: Jesus describes his followers as “sheep” who “listen to my voice” and “follow me” (v. 27). This isn’t a passive relationship but an active, ongoing response to his leadership. True believers are characterized not just by a one-time decision but by a pattern of listening and following.</p><p>The Gift of Eternal Life: Jesus says “I give them eternal life” (v. 28), using the present tense. This isn’t something he will give in the future but something he gives now to those who believe. Eternal life is a present possession, not just a future hope.</p><p>The Promise of Security: The phrase “they shall never perish” uses a double negative in Greek (οὐ μὴ ἀπόλωνται), which is the strongest possible way to express negation. Jesus is making an absolute, unconditional promise about the eternal destiny of his sheep.</p><h4>The Double Protection</h4><p>Jesus describes a double layer of protection for his sheep: they are in his hand, and his hand is in the Father’s hand (vv. 28-29). This creates an image of absolute security—to reach Jesus’s sheep, an enemy would have to overcome both the Son and the Father, which Jesus declares impossible because “no one is greater than all.”</p><p>This double protection suggests that eternal security rests not on the believer’s ability to hold onto God but on God’s ability to hold onto the believer. The security comes from God’s character and power, not from human faithfulness or performance.</p><h4>The Unity of Father and Son</h4><p>Jesus concludes this teaching by declaring “I and the Father are one” (v. 30). This statement of divine unity provides the ultimate foundation for eternal security. If Jesus and the Father are one in essence and purpose, then the promise of security comes with the full authority and power of the Godhead behind it.</p><h4>Old Testament Connection</h4><p>Jesus’s imagery of sheep and shepherd connects directly to Old Testament passages like Psalm 23 (”The Lord is my shepherd”) and Ezekiel 34, where God promises to be the shepherd of his people and to rescue them from those who would harm them.</p><p><strong>In Ezekiel 34:11-16, God declares:</strong> <br><em>“I myself will search for my sheep and look after them... I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered... I will tend them in a good pasture... I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak.”</em></p><p>Jesus is claiming to fulfill these ancient promises, positioning himself as the divine shepherd who provides ultimate security for God’s people.</p><h4>The Question of Perseverance</h4><p>While Jesus’s promise provides strong assurance of eternal security, it also raises questions about the relationship between security and perseverance. Notice that Jesus describes his sheep as those who “listen to my voice” and “follow me”—present, ongoing actions rather than past decisions.</p><p>This suggests that genuine faith naturally produces perseverance. The security isn’t despite a lack of faithfulness but through a faith that endures. True sheep continue to listen and follow not because they have to in order to maintain their salvation, but because that’s what genuine sheep naturally do.</p><h4>The Challenge to False Security</h4><p>Ironically, Jesus’s promise of security comes in a context where he’s challenging false assurance. The religious leaders who question him believe they have a relationship with God based on their religious heritage and practices, but Jesus tells them they “do not believe because you are not my sheep” (v. 26).</p><p>This suggests that not everyone who claims to be a believer actually belongs to Jesus’s flock. The promise of eternal security applies specifically to “my sheep”—those who genuinely belong to Jesus, as evidenced by their listening to his voice and following him.</p><h4>Implications for Assurance</h4><p>Jesus’s teaching provides both comfort and challenge for those seeking assurance of salvation:</p><p><em><strong>Comfort: </strong>Those who genuinely belong to Jesus can have absolute confidence in their eternal security. No external force can separate them from God’s love and protection.</em></p><p><em><strong>Challenge: </strong>The assurance is specifically for those who demonstrate the characteristics of Jesus’s sheep—listening to his voice and following him. This isn’t about perfect performance but about the genuine orientation of life toward Jesus.</em></p><h4>The Role of Evidence</h4><p>While salvation is by grace through faith alone, Jesus’s description of his sheep suggests that genuine faith produces evidence. True believers listen to Jesus’s voice (they’re responsive to his word) and follow him (they orient their lives around his leadership).</p><p>This evidence isn’t the cause of salvation but the natural result of genuine faith. Just as a healthy tree naturally produces fruit, genuine faith naturally produces the fruit of obedience and perseverance.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>How does Jesus’s promise of eternal security affect your understanding of your relationship with God?
