Luke 2:17-18</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Verse: </strong>Luke 2:17-18 - “When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.”</p><p><strong>Greek Word: </strong>διαγγέλλω (Diangello) - “To spread the word” or “to proclaim thoroughly.” This isn’t casual conversation but intentional communication of something important. The shepherds became the first evangelists, sharing what they had witnessed.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>If I became convinced that Jesus truly is the Savior, what would that conviction require of me? How would it change my priorities and relationships?</p><p><em><strong>Prayer:</strong> “Give me the courage to respond honestly to what I’ve learned about Jesus, and the wisdom to understand what that response should look like in my daily life.”</em></p><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Imagine you’re hiking in a remote area when you come across someone who has fallen and is seriously injured. They’re conscious but unable to move, and it’s clear they need immediate medical attention. You have a choice: you can continue on your planned route, perhaps telling yourself that someone else will probably find them, or you can change your plans entirely to get help.</p><p>If you choose to help, it will cost you something. You’ll have to abandon your original itinerary, use your phone battery to call for rescue, possibly wait for hours until help arrives, and maybe even carry the person to a location where they can be evacuated. Your entire day—maybe your entire trip—will be reorganized around this person’s need.</p><p>But here’s the thing: once you’ve seen the person and understood their condition, you can’t really go back to your original plans as if nothing has happened. The knowledge of their need creates a moral obligation that changes everything about your situation.</p><p>This is something like the position we find ourselves in after investigating Jesus’s claims. If we conclude that he truly is the Savior—that he offers something humanity desperately needs and can’t provide for itself—then we can’t simply file that information away and continue with our lives unchanged. The knowledge creates a responsibility to respond.</p><p>The shepherds in Luke’s account model this kind of response. They didn’t just receive the angels’ announcement and then return to their normal routine. They investigated the claim, confirmed its truth, and then “spread the word” about what they had discovered. Their encounter with the Messiah became the organizing principle of their immediate actions.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Genuine conviction about Jesus’s identity as Savior naturally leads to a reorientation of priorities and a desire to share that discovery with others.</em></p><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Personal Response:<br>From Recognition to Commitment</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: Luke 2:8-20 (NIV)<br></strong><em>8 And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. 9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 10 But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. 11 Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord.”12 This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.” 13 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, 14 “Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.” 16 So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. 17 When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, 18 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. 19 But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. 20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.</em></p></blockquote><h4>The Shepherds’ Response Pattern</h4><p>The shepherds’ reaction to the angels’ announcement provides a model for how we might respond to the claim that Jesus is the Savior:</p><p><em><strong>Investigation: </strong>They didn’t just accept the announcement at face value. They said, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened.” They moved from hearing a claim to personally investigating its truth.</em></p><p><em><strong>Confirmation: </strong>They “found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.” The evidence matched what they had been told, confirming the reliability of the message.</em></p><p><em><strong>Proclamation: </strong>They “spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child.” Their personal confirmation led to public testimony.</em></p><p><em><strong>Worship: </strong>They “returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen.” Their response included both intellectual acknowledgment and emotional/spiritual engagement.</em></p><h4>Accepting Jesus as Savior</h4><p>If we conclude that Jesus truly is the Savior, what does it mean to accept his salvation? This involves several interconnected elements:</p><p><strong>Acknowledging Need: </strong>Recognizing that we have a problem that requires external solution. This means moving beyond the assumption that we can save ourselves through our own efforts, wisdom, or goodness.</p><p><strong>Trusting the Solution: </strong>Believing that Jesus’s death and resurrection actually accomplish what they claim to accomplish—reconciliation with God, forgiveness of sins, and transformation of our fundamental relationship with the divine.</p><p><strong>Receiving the Gift: </strong>Accepting salvation as something freely given rather than earned. This can be challenging for people who are used to working for what they receive or who feel they need to prove their worthiness.</p><p><strong>Surrendering Control: </strong>Acknowledging Jesus as Lord means recognizing his authority over our lives. This doesn’t mean becoming passive, but it does mean aligning our will with his revealed will.</p><h4>Practical Steps of Response</h4><p>What would it look like to respond to Jesus’s claim to be Savior in concrete, practical terms?</p><p><strong>Honest Self-Assessment: </strong>Taking time to seriously examine our spiritual condition, acknowledging areas where we fall short of our own moral standards and recognizing our need for help beyond our own resources.</p><p><strong>Learning About Jesus: </strong>Studying his life, teachings, death, and resurrection to understand what he offers and what he requires. This might involve reading the Gospels, engaging with Christian literature, or participating in discussions with knowledgeable believers.</p><p><strong>Prayer and Communication: </strong>Beginning to communicate with God through prayer, expressing our questions, concerns, and desires for understanding and transformation.</p><p><strong>Community Engagement: </strong>Connecting with others who have made similar commitments, both for support and accountability. Faith rarely develops in isolation.</p><p><strong>Lifestyle Alignment: </strong>Beginning to align our choices, priorities, and relationships with Jesus’s teachings and example. This is a process rather than an instant transformation.</p><h4>Dealing with Doubt and Uncertainty</h4><p>Not everyone who investigates Jesus’s claims will arrive at complete certainty. Some may find themselves drawn to the message but still wrestling with questions or doubts. This is a normal and honest response to extraordinary claims.</p><p>The key is to respond authentically to whatever level of conviction we actually have. If we’re 60% convinced, we can take steps appropriate to that level of conviction while continuing to investigate. If we’re 90% convinced but still have specific concerns, we can address those concerns while moving forward with what we do believe.</p><p>Faith often grows gradually through experience and relationship rather than through purely intellectual argument. Taking small steps of trust can lead to greater confidence over time.</p><h4>The Cost of Discipleship</h4><p>Jesus himself was clear that following him involves cost. He spoke of taking up our cross, denying ourselves, and being willing to lose our life to find it. For modern people, this might involve:</p><p><em><strong>Reordering Priorities: </strong>Putting our relationship with God ahead of career advancement, material accumulation, or social approval when these conflict.</em></p><p><em><strong>Moral Transformation: </strong>Changing behaviors and attitudes that are inconsistent with Jesus’s teachings, even when this is difficult or socially awkward.</em></p><p><em><strong>Sacrificial Service: </strong>Using our time, resources, and abilities to serve others, particularly those who are marginalized or in need.</em></p><p><em><strong>Countercultural Witness: </strong>Being willing to stand for truth and justice even when it’s unpopular or costly.</em></p><h4>The Promise of Transformation</h4><p><strong>While following Jesus involves cost, it also comes with promises: </strong>peace with God, purpose in life, community with other believers, and hope for the future. Many people find that what initially feels like sacrifice becomes the path to greater fulfillment and joy.</p><p>The transformation Jesus offers isn’t just about behavior modification but about fundamental change in our identity, motivation, and relationship with God. This enables us to live with greater freedom, authenticity, and love.</p><h4>Starting Where You Are</h4><p>The beauty of Jesus’s offer is that we don’t have to have everything figured out before we begin. We can start where we are, with whatever level of understanding and commitment we currently have, and grow from there.</p><p>The shepherds didn’t become theologians overnight. They simply responded to what they had seen and heard, and their understanding deepened over time through continued experience and reflection.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>Based on your investigation this week, how convinced are you that Jesus is the Savior the angels announced?
