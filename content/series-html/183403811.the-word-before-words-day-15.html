John reveals that this source is not an impersonal force, but the <strong>Word</strong> — eternal, personal, divine.

We are not rushing toward conclusions.

reach clarity before drawing near.</p><p>Where in your life does everything still feel unformed or unresolved — and what would it mean to trust that the Word is already there, hovering, before anything has been spoken into place?</p><p>Take a moment.<br>This journey does not begin with answers, but with attention.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Prayer </h2><blockquote><p><strong>“Lord, you have been

A 700,000-ton block of granite, twice the weight of the Empire State Building, sheared off from the heart of the San José mine in Chile, sealing the exit and trapping them half a mile underground. The air filled with a thick, choking dust, blinding the men for hours. When it finally settled, they were confronted with a darkness so absolute it felt like a physical presence. The mine, a place of work and livelihood, had become their tomb. It was a modern tohu va-vohu, a formless, empty void where the familiar world had vanished.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath, panic was the first instinct. But then, one man, the shift foreman Luis Urzúa, began to act. He gathered the 33 men and led them to a small, reinforced “refuge” room, a tiny pocket of safety in the vast, unstable mine. He took inventory of their meager supplies: a few cans of tuna, some expired milk, and a handful of crackers. He organized the men, rationing the food and water, and establishing a sense of order in the midst of the chaos. He did not have a plan for rescue. He did not know if they would ever be found. His first act was simply to be present with his men in their shared darkness.</p><p>For seventeen days, this was their reality. They were a small community suspended in the void, with no word from the outside world. They were not yet being rescued. They were not yet being supplied. They were simply being held. Urzúa’s leadership, his calm and steady presence, was an echo of the first act of God. Before the light, before the separation, before the creation of life, there was the Spirit of God, hovering over the deep, a protective presence in the chaos. The story of the 33 did not begin with a rescue plan, but with a leader who chose to be present in the void.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong>God’s first act in our chaos is not to fix it, but to be present in it.</em></p><div><hr></div><h2>Go Deeper</h2><h4>Scripture Reading (NIV)</h4><p><strong>Genesis 1:1–2</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>1</strong> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.<br><strong>2</strong> Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.</p></blockquote><p><strong>John 1:1–2</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>1</strong> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br><strong>2</strong> He was with God in the beginning.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h4>What’s Happening in the Text?</h4><p>Genesis opens with a world that exists but is unfinished. Darkness is present, not as evil, but as <strong>potential</strong>. Nothing has gone wrong — nothing has yet been spoken.</p><p>And God is already there.</p><p>The Spirit of God <em>hovers</em> — watchful, attentive, unhurried. Before light is created, before order is established, God is near.</p><p>John then reveals what Genesis does not yet name: the speaking God speaks through <strong>the Word</strong>. Creation begins not with force or distance, but with relationship. The Word was <em>with God</em> and <em>was God</em>. When God speaks, He does so from within Himself.</p><p><em><strong>The beginning is not empty.<br>It is already full of presence.</strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h2>Key Word or Concept</h2><p><strong>Bereshet (בְּרֵאשִׁית)</strong> — commonly translated <em>“In the beginning,”</em> but rooted in a word meaning <strong>head</strong>, <strong>source</strong>, or <strong>origin</strong>.</p><p>John confirms what Bereshet implies: the source of all things is not an idea, but <strong>the Word Himself</strong>.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Community Reflection</h2><p>If you’re willing, share in the comments:</p><ul><li><p>What does <em>“the beginning”</em> feel like in your life right now?</p></li><li><p>Where are you sensing possibility, uncertainty, or waiting?</p></li></ul><p>There’s no need to resolve it yet.<br>This space is for noticing, not fixing.</p><div><hr></div><h2>This Week’s Journey</h2><p>This is <strong>Day 1 of 5</strong>.</p><p>This week, we will move carefully from <em>presence</em> to <em>speech</em>, from <em>light</em> to <em>life</em>, tracing how the Word who was present at creation becomes the Light who enters the darkness.</p><p>Tomorrow, we will listen for what happens <strong>when God speaks</strong> — and why light is the very first gift He gives. <strong>Below is a link to the study guide document, with a more detailed dive into the scripture.</strong> </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/the-word-before-words-week-1-deep?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Deep Dive&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/wokegod/p/the-word-before-words-week-1-deep?r=32c4cy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true"><span>Deep Dive</span></a></p><div><hr></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wokegod.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"><strong>Don't miss Day 2: </strong>Subscribe to get tomorrow's daily devotion delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p>
