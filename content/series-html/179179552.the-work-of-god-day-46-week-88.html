profound claim, “I am the bread of life.” Today, he addresses the painful reality of unbelief. Despite seeing his signs and hearing his words, the crowd still does not believe. Jesus then shifts the focus from human response to divine initiative. He speaks of the Father’s sovereign role in drawing people to himself, introducing one of the most debated and mysterious theological concepts in Scripture: the relationship between divine sovereignty and human free will.

John 6:37</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Passage:</strong> John 6:36-37 - “All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.”</p><p><strong>Greek Word:</strong> δίδωμι (didōmi) - “I give.” This word is used for both the Father “giving” believers to the Son, and for Jesus “giving” eternal life to them. The entire process of salvation, from beginning to end, is a gift.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question:</strong> Do I tend to focus more on my responsibility to believe, or on God’s sovereign grace in drawing me? How does holding both truths in tension change my perspective?</p><p><strong>Urgency Moment:</strong> Stop trying to figure it all out. Today, instead of trying to resolve the theological tension between sovereignty and free will, simply rest in the two promises of this verse: God is sovereignly at work, and Jesus will never turn you away.</p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“Father, thank you for the gift of faith. Thank you for drawing me to your Son. Jesus, thank you for the promise that you will never drive me away. Help me to rest in the security of your sovereign grace.”</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Liam found his brother, Mark, in the backyard, throwing a football with his son. Mark was the successful one, the one who seemed to have it all figured out. He was a partner at his law firm, had a beautiful family, and lived a life that Liam had always envied.</p><p>“He’s got a great arm,” Liam said, nodding toward his nephew.</p><p>“He does,” Mark agreed, a rare, unguarded smile on his face. “But he’s got no interest in playing for the school team. He’d rather be in the drama club.”</p><p>“Nothing wrong with that,” Liam said.</p><p>“I know. It’s just... not what I expected.” Mark paused, then looked at Liam. “You seem different this year. Calmer.”</p><p>Liam was surprised. He hadn’t realized it was so noticeable. “I guess I am,” he said. “I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. About what really matters.”</p><p>He decided to take a risk. “I’ve been reading the Bible. The Gospel of John.”</p><p>Mark raised an eyebrow. “Still into that stuff, huh? I grew out of it in college. All the contradictions, the theological debates... I couldn’t reconcile it all. Sovereignty and free will, predestination and choice... it’s a mess.”</p><p>“I used to think so too,” Liam said. “I used to think I had to have it all figured out before I could believe. But I read something that changed my perspective.”</p><p>He pulled out his phone and found the verse. “Jesus says, ‘All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.’”</p><p>“See?” Mark said, gesturing with the football. “Contradiction. Either God chooses us, or we choose him. It can’t be both.”</p><p>“I don’t think it’s a contradiction,” Liam said slowly, working it out as he spoke. “I think it’s a paradox. It’s two truths held in tension. It’s like... it’s like this football. From my perspective, I can choose to pick it up or leave it on the ground. That’s my choice. But from a higher perspective, the laws of physics are governing everything about this ball—its mass, its velocity, the force of gravity acting on it. My choice and the laws of physics are both true at the same time. They operate on different levels.”</p><p>He continued, “The first part of the verse—‘All those the Father gives me will come to me’—that’s God’s perspective. It’s the ultimate reality, the divine physics of salvation. It gives me security, knowing that this whole thing is in his hands, not mine.</p><p>“The second part—‘whoever comes to me I will never drive away’—that’s my perspective. It’s the human experience. It’s the open invitation. It gives me responsibility and assurance. It means the door is always open. I don’t have to worry about whether I’m one of the ‘chosen.’ I just have to come.”</p><p>Mark was silent, looking at the football in his hands. He didn’t seem convinced, but he was listening.</p><p>“I spent my whole life trying to earn my way, to prove I was good enough,” Liam said. “For Dad, for you, for God. I thought it was all up to me. But realizing that God is the one doing the work, that he’s the one drawing me... it’s like a huge weight has been lifted. And at the same time, knowing that the invitation is open to whoever comes... it makes me want to come. It’s not a contradiction; it’s a comfort.”</p><p>He didn’t know if his words had made any difference to his brother. But they had made a difference to him. In trying to explain the paradox, he had come to understand it more deeply himself. His faith was not a philosophical puzzle to be solved, but a relationship to be lived, held securely in the tension between God’s sovereign hand and his open arms.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong>The tension between divine sovereignty and human responsibility is not a problem to be solved, but a comfort to be embraced. It means that our salvation is both divinely secured and personally assured.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Practical and Theological Focus:<br>The Divine Tension: Sovereignty and Responsibility</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: John 6:25-40 (NIV)</strong><br><em>25 When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” 26 Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. 27 Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.” 28 Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” 29 Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.” 30 So they asked him, “What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? 31 Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” 32 Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” 34 “Sir,” they said, “always give us this bread.” 35 Then Jesus declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. 36 But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. 37 All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. 38 For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. 39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. 40 For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.”</em></p></blockquote><h4>The Painful Diagnosis</h4><p>Jesus begins verse 36 with a blunt diagnosis: “But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.” Despite the miracles, despite the teaching, despite his clear declaration of being the bread of life, their hearts remain closed. This is the tragic reality of human unbelief.</p><h4>The Two Sides of Salvation</h4><p>In verse 37, Jesus presents two truths that seem to be in tension, but are in fact two sides of the same coin.</p><p><strong>1. Divine Sovereignty: </strong>“All those the Father gives me will come to me...”</p><p><em>This speaks to God’s sovereign initiative in salvation. It is the Father who chooses, who draws, who “gives” people to the Son. Our salvation does not ultimately depend on our own wisdom, strength, or goodness, but on God’s gracious choice.</em></p><p><em>This truth provides security and humility. It is security because our salvation is held in the powerful hands of God. It is humility because we cannot take credit for our own salvation; it is a gift from beginning to end.</em></p><p><strong>2. Human Responsibility and Assurance:</strong> “...and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.”</p><p><em>This speaks to the open invitation of the gospel and our responsibility to respond. The call is to “whoever”—it is universal and unconditional.</em></p><p><em>The promise is one of radical acceptance: “I will never drive away.” No matter who you are, what you have done, or how weak your faith is, if you come to Jesus, he will receive you.</em></p><p><em>This truth provides assurance and responsibility. It is assurance because we don’t have to wonder if we are “elect”; we just have to come. It is responsibility because the choice to come is ours to make.</em></p><h4>How to Hold the Tension</h4><p>Throughout church history, theologians have debated how to reconcile these two truths. Some emphasize divine sovereignty to the point of minimizing human responsibility (Calvinism). Others emphasize human free will to the point of minimizing God’s sovereignty (Arminianism).</p><p>John’s Gospel, however, simply presents both truths side-by-side without trying to resolve the philosophical tension. The Bible is not a systematic theology textbook; it is a revelation of God’s character and his relationship with humanity.</p><p><strong>Perhaps the best way to understand this is to see it from two different perspectives:</strong></p><p><strong>Looking back from the perspective of a believer: </strong><em>A believer can look back on their life and see God’s sovereign hand at work, drawing them to himself at every step. From this perspective, their salvation is clearly a work of God’s grace.</em></p><p><strong>Looking forward from the perspective of a seeker: </strong><em>A seeker is confronted with a simple, direct command: come to Jesus. From this perspective, the choice is theirs to make, and the promise of acceptance is absolute.</em></p><h3>Old Testament Connection</h3><p>The interplay between divine sovereignty and human responsibility is a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament.</p><p><em><strong>The Story of Joseph:</strong> God sovereignly ordained Joseph’s journey to Egypt to save his family from famine. Yet, at every step, Joseph and his brothers made real, responsible choices—some good, some evil.

The first phrase speaks of the collective group that the Father gives to the Son. The second phrase shifts to the individual person who comes to Jesus. This beautifully illustrates the two perspectives: God sees his people as a collective whole, but he welcomes them as individuals.</p><h4>Memory Tip</h4><p><strong>Remember the two promises of verse 37:</strong></p><ol><li><p>God’s Promise to the Son: All that the Father gives me will come.</p></li><li><p>The Son’s Promise to Us: Whoever comes to me I will never drive away.</p></li></ol><h4>Practice Exercise</h4><p><strong>Identify the source of the action (God or Human):</strong></p><ol><li><p>δίδωμι (giving believers) = ?</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p>ἔρχομαι (coming to Jesus) = ?</p></li></ol><ol start="3"><li><p>ἐκβάλλω (casting out) = ?
