We’re almost there!</p><p><strong>Key Words We Can Now Read:</strong><br>•בְּרֵאשִׁית (Bereshit) - In the beginning<br>•בָּרָא (bara) - created<br>•אֱלֹהִים (Elohim) - God<br>•אוֹר (or) - light<br>•טוֹב (tov) - good<br>•יוֹם (yom) - day</p><p><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>How has learning to read these Hebrew words changed your understanding of Genesis?</p><p><em><strong>Prayer:</strong> “God, thank You for the privilege of reading Your word in the language You chose to reveal it. As I practice these verses, help me not just to pronounce the words correctly, but to understand more deeply who You are and what You have done.”</em></p><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Dr. William Tyndale was a 16th-century English scholar who believed that every person should be able to read the Bible in their own language. At the time, the Bible was only available in Latin, which most people couldn’t read. When Tyndale requested permission to translate the Bible into English, he was refused by church authorities who wanted to maintain control over biblical interpretation.</p><p>Undeterred, Tyndale left England and began working on his translation in secret. He taught himself Hebrew and Greek, spending years mastering the original languages of Scripture. He would often say, “I cannot translate what I do not understand, and I cannot understand what I have not learned to read in the original.”</p><p>Tyndale’s approach to translation was revolutionary. Instead of simply translating from the Latin Vulgate (which was itself a translation), he went back to the Hebrew and Greek manuscripts. He spent months on single verses, trying to capture not just the meaning but the rhythm, beauty, and power of the original languages.</p><p>One of the verses that gave Tyndale the most difficulty was Genesis 1:1. He wrote in his journal: “How do you translate ‘Bereshit bara Elohim’? ‘In the beginning God created’—but these simple English words cannot capture the weight, the authority, the creative power that pulses through the Hebrew. When you read ‘Bereshit’ in Hebrew, you feel the absolute beginning of everything. When you read ‘bara,’ you sense the unique creative power that belongs to God alone. When you read ‘Elohim,’ you encounter the majestic plurality-in-unity of the divine nature.”</p><p>Tyndale’s Hebrew studies convinced him that every Christian should have the opportunity to encounter Scripture in its original languages. He wrote, “The Hebrew text is like a clear spring of water. Each translation is like a bucket drawn from that spring. The bucket may be clean and useful, but it can never contain all the freshness, clarity, and life of the spring itself.”</p><p>When Tyndale’s English New Testament was published in 1526, it was immediately banned and burned by church authorities. Tyndale himself was eventually captured, tried for heresy, and executed in 1536. His last words were reportedly, “Lord, open the King of England’s eyes.”</p><p>Remarkably, just three years later, King Henry VIII authorized the publication of an English Bible—a Bible that was largely based on Tyndale’s translation work. Today, scholars estimate that about 80% of the King James Version comes directly from Tyndale’s translation.</p><p>But perhaps Tyndale’s greatest legacy was his conviction that ordinary people could and should read Scripture in the original languages. He believed that Hebrew and Greek weren’t just for scholars—they were for anyone who wanted to encounter God’s word in its fullest power and beauty.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Learning to read Scripture in its original languages isn’t just an academic exercise—it’s a way of encountering God’s word with greater depth, clarity, and power.</em></p><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Theological and Historical Focus: <br>The Foundation of Everything</h4><p>As we review Genesis 1:1-5, we’re looking at the foundation upon which all biblical truth rests. These five verses establish the fundamental realities that shape everything else in Scripture: the existence of God, the creation of the universe, the power of God’s word, the goodness of creation, and the rhythm of time.</p><h4>Verse-by-Verse Review:</h4><p><strong>Genesis 1:1 - The Declaration of Creation<br></strong>“Bereshit bara Elohim et hashamayim v’et ha’aretz”</p><p>This verse establishes that God is the Creator of everything that exists. The word “bara” (created) is used exclusively for divine activity—only God can create something from nothing. The phrase “hashamayim v’et ha’aretz” (the heavens and the earth) is a Hebrew idiom meaning “everything that exists.”</p><h4>Genesis 1:2 - The State of Chaos</h4><p>“V’ha’aretz haytah tohu vavohu v’choshech al-p’nei t’hom v’ruach Elohim m’rachefet al-p’nei hamayim”</p><p>This verse describes the unformed state of creation before God’s ordering work begins. The phrase “tohu vavohu” (formless and void) suggests chaos and purposelessness. But the Spirit of God (ruach Elohim) is hovering over the waters, ready to bring order and life.</p><h4>Genesis 1:3 - The First Word</h4><p>“Vayomer Elohim yehi or vayehi or”</p><p>God’s first spoken words in Scripture are “yehi or” (let there be light). This demonstrates the absolute power of divine speech—God doesn’t struggle to create; He simply speaks, and reality obeys. The immediate response “vayehi or” (and there was light) shows the perfect correspondence between God’s word and reality.</p><h4>Genesis 1:4 - The Divine Evaluation</h4><p>“Vayar Elohim et-ha’or ki-tov vayavdel Elohim bein ha’or u’vein hachoshech”</p><p>God evaluates His work and declares it “tov” (good). This establishes God as the standard of goodness and beauty. The separation of light from darkness creates the fundamental distinction between order and chaos, good and evil.</p><h4>Genesis 1:5 - The Establishment of Time</h4><p>“Vayikra Elohim la’or yom v’lachoshech kara laylah vayehi-erev vayehi-voker yom echad”</p><p>God names the light “yom” (day) and the darkness “laylah” (night), exercising His authority over time itself. The pattern of “erev” (evening) before “voker” (morning) establishes the rhythm of rest before work that will govern all of life.</p><h4>The Progressive Revelation</h4><p>These five verses reveal God’s character progressively:<br><em><strong>Verse 1:</strong> God as Creator<br><strong>Verse 2:</strong> God as present in chaos<br><strong>Verse 3: </strong>God as powerful in speech<br><strong>Verse 4:</strong> God as evaluator of goodness<br><strong>Verse 5:</strong> God as establisher of rhythm</em></p><h4>The Connection to Christ</h4><p>Every verse in this passage points forward to Christ:<br><em><strong>Verse 1:</strong> Christ as the Word through whom all things were made (John 1:3)<br><strong>Verse 2:</strong> Christ as the one who brings order to our chaos (2 Corinthians 5:17)<br><strong>Verse 3: </strong>Christ as the Light of the world (John 8:12)<br><strong>Verse 4:</strong> Christ as the one who is perfectly good (Mark 10:18)<br><strong>Verse 5:</strong> Christ as the one who gives us rest (Matthew 11:28)</em></p><h4>The Hebrew Language Insights</h4><p><strong>Learning to read these verses in Hebrew reveals insights that are often lost in translation:</strong><br><em>•The word “Elohim” is grammatically plural but takes singular verbs, hinting at the Trinity<br>•The verb “bara” (created) is used only for divine activity, never for human making<br>•The phrase “ruach Elohim” can mean “Spirit of God” or “wind of God,” showing the connection between God’s breath and His Spirit<br>•The word “tov” (good) encompasses functional, aesthetic, and moral goodness all in one<br>•The pattern of evening before morning reflects God’s priority of rest over work</em></p><h4>The Ecclesiastes Connection</h4><p><strong>These verses provide the foundation for understanding the themes in Ecclesiastes:</strong><em><br>•The “beginning” of Genesis contrasts with the “vanity” of Ecclesiastes<br>•The “goodness” of creation contrasts with the futility of fallen existence<br>•The “order” of creation contrasts with the confusion of life under the sun<br>•The “purpose” of creation contrasts with the meaninglessness of life apart from God</em></p><h4>The Practical Application</h4><p>As we learn to read these verses in Hebrew, we’re not just acquiring academic knowledge—we’re developing a deeper relationship with God’s word. The Hebrew text connects us more directly to the original revelation, allowing us to hear God’s voice with greater clarity and power.</p><h4>Why This Matters for Us</h4><p>Learning to read Genesis 1:1-5 in Hebrew is more than a linguistic achievement—it’s a spiritual milestone. These verses contain the foundation of our faith, and reading them in the original language connects us more directly to God’s revelation.</p><p>As we continue our journey through the remaining weeks, we’ll build on this foundation, learning to read more of Genesis 1 and discovering how the entire creation account points us toward Christ as the Creator, Sustainer, and Redeemer of all things.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Hebrew Reading Practice</h3><p><strong>Complete Text of Genesis 1:1-5:</strong></p><p>                                                  בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ׃<br>וְהָאָרֶץ הָיְתָה תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ וְחֹשֶׁךְ עַל־פְּנֵי תְהוֹם וְרוּחַ אֱלֹהִים מְרַחֶפֶת עַל־פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם׃<br>                                                                      וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים יְהִי אוֹר וַיְהִי־אוֹר׃<br>                    וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים אֶת־הָאוֹר כִּי־טוֹב וַיַּבְדֵּל אֱלֹהִים בֵּין הָאוֹר וּבֵין הַחֹשֶׁךְ׃<br>             וַיִּקְרָא אֱלֹהִים לָאוֹר יוֹם וְלַחֹשֶׁךְ קָרָא לָיְלָה וַיְהִי־עֶרֶב וַיְהִי־בֹקֶר יוֹם אֶחָד׃</p><p><strong>Reading Tips:</strong><br>•Remember that Hebrew reads from right to left<br>•Take your time with each word<br>•Don’t worry about perfect pronunciation—focus on recognition<br>•Notice how the same letters appear in different combinations<br>•Pay attention to the rhythm and flow of the Hebrew text</p><p><strong>Vocabulary Review:</strong><br>•בְּרֵאשִׁית (Bereshit) - In the beginning<br>•בָּרָא (bara) - created<br>•אֱלֹהִים (Elohim) - God<br>•שָׁמַיִם (shamayim) - heavens<br>•אֶרֶץ (eretz) - earth<br>•רוּחַ (ruach) - spirit/wind<br>•אוֹר (or) - light<br>•טוֹב (tov) - good<br>•יוֹם (yom) - day<br>•לַיְלָה (laylah) - night</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>How has learning to read these Hebrew words changed your understanding of Genesis 1:1-5?
