John 20:31</h4><div><hr></div><h2>Quickstart (1 Minute Commitment)</h2><p><strong>Today’s Verse: </strong>John 20:31 - “But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.”</p><p><strong>Greek Word:</strong> ζωή (Zoe) - “Life.” This isn’t just biological existence but abundant, meaningful, eternal life—life as it was meant to be lived in relationship with God.</p><p><strong>Reflection Question: </strong>If I truly believed that Jesus offers this kind of life, what would need to change in my priorities and commitments?</p><p><em><strong>Prayer: </strong>“Give me the courage to respond honestly to what I’ve learned about Jesus, and the wisdom to understand what that response should look like.”</em></p><h3>Story Time (5 Minutes)</h3><p>Three months after Sarah Chen’s article was published, she sat in a coffee shop in downtown DC, scrolling through her emails. The response to her story had been everything she had feared and more than she had hoped. Several colleagues had questioned her journalistic integrity, suggesting she had been “captured” by the researchers she was supposed to be investigating. Two medical journals had published letters criticizing her “uncritical acceptance” of extraordinary claims.</p><p>But other responses had surprised her. Dr. Patricia Williams, the oncologist from Johns Hopkins who had initially been skeptical of the treatment, had sent a personal note thanking Sarah for her courage in reporting the story. “Your article gave me permission to look at the evidence with fresh eyes,” she wrote. “I’ve now referred twelve patients to Houston, and eight of them are showing remarkable improvement.”</p><p>More importantly, Sarah had received dozens of emails from patients and families who had read her story and decided to pursue the treatment. Maria Santos, the mother of three Sarah had interviewed, had sent a photo of her family at her daughter’s graduation—an event she had never expected to see.</p><p>The professional cost had been real. Sarah had lost some assignments and faced skepticism from editors who questioned whether she could still be objective about medical stories. But she had also gained something unexpected: a reputation for intellectual honesty that was attracting sources who wanted to work with a journalist willing to follow evidence wherever it led, even when it challenged conventional wisdom.</p><p>As Sarah reflected on the past three months, she realized that her investigation had changed more than her career—it had changed her understanding of what it meant to be truly rational. Sometimes the most logical thing you could do was believe something that seemed impossible, when the evidence demanded it.</p><p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Responding to compelling evidence often requires us to accept personal costs in exchange for intellectual integrity and the opportunity to align our lives with truth.</em></p><h3>Deep Dive (15 Minutes)</h3><h4>Personal Response:<br>Moving from Belief to Commitment</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Full Passage: John 20:30-31 (NIV)</strong><br>30 Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. 31 But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</p></blockquote><h4>John’s Explicit Purpose</h4><p>John concludes his account of Thomas with a clear statement of purpose: he has written his Gospel to produce faith in Jesus as “the Messiah, the Son of God,” and he promises that such faith will result in “life in his name.” This isn’t just historical reporting—it’s an invitation to personal response.</p><p>The word John uses for “believe” (πιστεύω - pisteuo) is the same word used throughout his Gospel, but here it’s connected directly to the promise of “life.” This suggests that belief, properly understood, isn’t just intellectual acknowledgment but a trust that transforms how we live.</p><h4>What Does It Mean to Believe?</h4><p>Thomas’s journey helps us understand what John means by “believe.” It involves several interconnected elements:</p><p><em><strong>Honest Investigation: </strong>Thomas didn’t suppress his doubts or accept claims uncritically. He investigated carefully and specified what kind of evidence would convince him.</em></p><p><em><strong>Openness to Evidence: </strong>When Jesus provided the requested proof, Thomas didn’t dismiss it or demand additional evidence. He was willing to be convinced by sufficient proof.</em></p><p><em><strong>Personal Encounter: </strong>Thomas didn’t rely solely on others’ testimony but insisted on his own encounter with the risen Jesus.</em></p><p><em><strong>Total Response: </strong>Thomas’s declaration—”My Lord and my God!”—involved both intellectual acknowledgment and personal allegiance. He didn’t just believe facts about Jesus; he committed himself to Jesus as Lord.</em></p><h4>The Promise of Life</h4><p>John promises that believing in Jesus results in “life in his name.” This “life” (ζωή - zoe) is qualitatively different from mere biological existence. It’s the kind of life that comes from being in right relationship with God, with others, and with our own deepest purpose.</p><p>This life begins now but extends beyond death. It’s characterized by peace, purpose, love, hope, and the security that comes from knowing we’re accepted by God not because of our performance but because of Jesus’s work on our behalf.</p><h4>Practical Steps of Response</h4><p>If someone today wanted to respond to John’s invitation as Thomas did, what would that look like? Several practical steps emerge from Thomas’s example:</p><p><em><strong>Honest Self-Assessment: </strong>Acknowledging where we stand in relation to Jesus’s claims. Are we skeptical? Curious? Partially convinced? Resistant? The starting point is honesty about our actual condition.</em></p><p><em><strong>Serious Investigation: </strong>Taking time to examine the evidence for Jesus’s identity and resurrection. This might involve reading the Gospels carefully, studying historical evidence, engaging with thoughtful Christian literature, or discussing questions with knowledgeable believers.</em></p><p><em><strong>Prayer and Openness: </strong>Expressing willingness to be convinced if the evidence warrants it. This might involve praying something like, “God, if you’re real and if Jesus is who he claimed to be, help me to see the truth and give me the courage to respond appropriately.”</em></p><p><em><strong>Community Engagement: </strong>Connecting with others who have made similar commitments, both for support and accountability. Faith rarely develops or survives in isolation.</em></p><p><em><strong>Gradual Commitment: </strong>Beginning to align our choices and priorities with Jesus’s teachings and example. This is a process rather than an instant transformation.</em></p><h4>Dealing with Doubt and Uncertainty</h4><p>Not everyone who investigates Jesus’s claims will arrive at Thomas’s level of certainty. Some may find themselves drawn to the message but still wrestling with questions or doubts. This is normal and doesn’t disqualify someone from beginning to respond to what they do understand and believe.</p><p>The key is to respond authentically to whatever level of conviction we actually have. If we’re 60% convinced, we can take steps appropriate to that level of conviction while continuing to investigate. If we’re 90% convinced but still have specific concerns, we can address those concerns while moving forward with what we do believe.</p><p>Faith often grows gradually through experience and relationship rather than through purely intellectual argument. Taking small steps of trust can lead to greater confidence over time.</p><h4>The Cost of Discipleship</h4><p>Thomas’s declaration of Jesus as “Lord” wasn’t just a theological statement—it was a commitment to follow Jesus’s leadership in his life. Jesus himself was clear that following him involves cost: taking up our cross, denying ourselves, and being willing to lose our life to find it.</p><p><strong>For modern people, this might involve:</strong><br><em><strong>Reordering Priorities: </strong>Putting our relationship with God ahead of career advancement, material accumulation, or social approval when these conflict.</em></p><p><em><strong>Moral Transformation: </strong>Changing behaviors and attitudes that are inconsistent with Jesus’s teachings, even when this is difficult or socially awkward.</em></p><p><em><strong>Sacrificial Service: </strong>Using our time, resources, and abilities to serve others, particularly those who are marginalized or in need.</em></p><p><em><strong>Countercultural Witness: </strong>Being willing to stand for truth and justice even when it’s unpopular or costly.</em></p><h4>The Promise of Transformation</h4><p>While following Jesus involves cost, it also comes with promises: peace with God, purpose in life, community with other believers, and hope for the future. Many people find that what initially feels like sacrifice becomes the path to greater fulfillment and joy.</p><p>The transformation Jesus offers isn’t just about behavior modification but about fundamental change in our identity, motivation, and relationship with God. This enables us to live with greater freedom, authenticity, and love.</p><h4>Starting Where You Are</h4><p>The beauty of Jesus’s offer is that we don’t have to have everything figured out before we begin. We can start where we are, with whatever level of understanding and commitment we currently have, and grow from there.</p><p>Thomas didn’t become a theologian overnight. He simply responded to what he had seen and experienced, and his understanding deepened over time through continued relationship with Jesus and the community of believers.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Optional Journal Reflection</h3><ol><li><p>Based on your investigation this week, how convinced are you that Jesus is “the Messiah, the Son of God”?
