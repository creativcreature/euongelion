## Track 1: Why Believe? (vs. Atheism)

**Days:** 20
**Target:** Skeptics, doubters, intellectual seekers

---

### Day 1: The Question That Won't Go Away

**Key Question:** Why do humans keep asking if God exists?
**Main Thesis:** The persistence of the God question across all cultures and ages suggests it touches something fundamental about human nature—we are wired to seek meaning beyond ourselves.
**Scripture Focus:** Ecclesiastes 3:11 — "He has set eternity in the human heart."
**Content Direction:**

- Open with modern story of an atheist who couldn't stop asking "why"
- Explore the universality of religious belief across human history
- Introduce the concept of "signals of transcendence" (Peter Berger)

---

### Day 2: Something from Nothing?

**Key Question:** Why is there something rather than nothing?
**Main Thesis:** The existence of the universe demands an explanation—and the most reasonable explanation is a transcendent cause outside of space and time.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 1:1 — "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."
**Content Direction:**

- Present the Kalam Cosmological Argument (Craig)
- Discuss Big Bang cosmology and its theistic implications
- Address "What caused God?" objection with the concept of necessary vs. contingent beings

---

### Day 3: The Universe Knew We Were Coming

**Key Question:** Why is the universe so precisely fine-tuned for life?
**Main Thesis:** The mathematical precision required for life suggests intentional design rather than chance.
**Scripture Focus:** Psalm 19:1 — "The heavens declare the glory of God."
**Content Direction:**

- Present fine-tuning constants (gravitational force, strong nuclear force, cosmological constant)
- Address multiverse objections honestly
- Quote Fred Hoyle: "A common sense interpretation of the facts suggests a superintellect has monkeyed with physics"

---

### Day 4: The Moral Compass Within

**Key Question:** If there's no God, where does morality come from?
**Main Thesis:** Objective moral values and duties point to a moral lawgiver—without God, morality reduces to personal preference or social convention.
**Scripture Focus:** Romans 2:14-15 — "The law written on their hearts."
**Content Direction:**

- Present the Moral Argument (C.S. Lewis formulation)
- Distinguish between moral epistemology (how we know) and moral ontology (what grounds it)
- Address evolutionary explanations for morality and their limitations

---

### Day 5: The Mind Behind the Mind

**Key Question:** Why can we trust our own reasoning?
**Main Thesis:** If our minds are merely products of blind evolution, we have no reason to trust them—but if we're made in the image of a rational God, our reason makes sense.

**Content Direction:**

- Present the Argument from Reason (C.S. Lewis, Alvin Plantinga)
- Explore the "evolutionary argument against naturalism"
- Discuss consciousness and why materialism struggles to explain it

---

### Day 6: The Longing for Home

**Content Direction:**

- Present the Argument from Desire (C.S. Lewis)
- Explore why wealth, fame, and pleasure never fully satisfy
- Modern story of someone who "had everything" but found it empty

---

### Day 7: Who Made God?

**Key Question:** If everything needs a cause, what caused God?
**Main Thesis:** The question misunderstands the argument—not everything needs a cause, only things that begin to exist. God, by definition, is eternal and uncaused.

**Content Direction:**

- Distinguish between "everything has a cause" and "everything that begins has a cause"
- Explain the concept of necessary existence
- Address infinite regress problems with alternative explanations

---

### Day 8: If God Is Good, Why Is There Evil?

**Key Question:** How can an all-powerful, all-good God allow suffering?
**Main Thesis:** The problem of evil is serious, but it doesn't disprove God—rather, it invites us into the mystery of free will, redemption, and ultimate justice.
**Scripture Focus:** Habakkuk 1:13 and 3:17-19 — Questioning God and choosing trust.
**Content Direction:**

- Present the logical and evidential problems of evil fairly
- Introduce Alvin Plantinga's Free Will Defense
- Be honest: this is the hardest question, and pat answers dishonor the suffering

---

### Day 9: Types of Evil: Why the Distinction Matters

**Key Question:** Are natural disasters and human cruelty the same kind of problem?
**Main Thesis:** Distinguishing moral evil (human choices) from natural evil (earthquakes, disease) helps us understand different dimensions of the problem.
**Scripture Focus:** Romans 8:20-22 — "The creation was subjected to frustration."
**Content Direction:**

- Define moral evil, natural evil, and their interrelation
- Discuss how human sin affects the created order (Genesis 3)
- Explore why a world with genuine free will requires real consequences

---

### Day 10: Free Will and the Possibility of Love

**Key Question:** Could God have made a world without the possibility of evil?
**Main Thesis:** Love requires freedom, and freedom requires the possibility of its misuse—a world of robots could not love.
**Scripture Focus:** Deuteronomy 30:19 — "I have set before you life and death...choose life."
**Content Direction:**

- Explore why genuine relationship requires genuine choice
- Address "Could God have created only people who would freely choose good?"
- Story of a parent who gave their child freedom—and watched them struggle

---

### Day 11: Suffering and the Cross

**Key Question:** What does Christianity offer that other worldviews don't when it comes to suffering?
**Main Thesis:** Christianity alone presents a God who entered into suffering, bore it on our behalf, and will one day end it forever.
**Scripture Focus:** Isaiah 53:3-5 — "A man of sorrows, acquainted with grief."
**Content Direction:**

- Contrast Christian theodicy with Eastern (illusion), atheist (meaningless), and Islamic (divine will) responses

- Quote Dostoyevsky: "I believe like a child that suffering will be healed"

---

### Day 12: The Atheist's Problem with Evil

**Key Question:** If God doesn't exist, is evil even a problem?
**Main Thesis:** The very concept of "evil" assumes a standard of good—and that standard is hard to ground without God.

**Content Direction:**

- Turn the problem of evil into an argument for God (Lewis, Keller)
- If there's no God, on what basis do we call anything truly evil?
- The irony: moral outrage at suffering presumes moral order

---

### Day 13: Where Is God When It Hurts?

**Key Question:** How do I find God in the midst of personal suffering?
**Main Thesis:** God doesn't always remove suffering, but He promises His presence in it—and uses it for purposes we may not see this side of eternity.
**Scripture Focus:** Psalm 23:4 — "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you are with me."
**Content Direction:**

---

### Day 14: Testimonies from the Darkness

**Key Question:** Has anyone found faith through suffering rather than losing it?
**Main Thesis:** Countless people have encountered God most powerfully in their darkest moments—suffering can be a strange doorway to faith.

**Content Direction:**

- Multiple brief testimonies: cancer survivor, bereaved parent, Holocaust survivor (Corrie ten Boom)
- Pattern: Many describe suffering as what drove them to God, not away
- The credibility of witnesses who suffered for their faith (martyrs)

---

### Day 15: Is Faith Blind?

**Key Question:** Does faith mean believing without evidence?
**Main Thesis:** Biblical faith is trust based on evidence, not belief despite evidence—it's more like trusting a doctor than wishing on a star.
**Scripture Focus:** Hebrews 11:1 — "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
**Content Direction:**

- Define biblical faith vs. pop-culture "blind faith"
- Greek: _pistis_ includes trust, fidelity, evidence-based confidence
- Historical examples: disciples needed evidence (doubting Thomas, 1 Cor 15)

---

### Day 16: Christianity and the Birth of Science

**Key Question:** Didn't the church oppose science throughout history?
**Main Thesis:** The "conflict thesis" is historically false—Christianity provided the worldview foundations for modern science.
**Scripture Focus:** Proverbs 25:2 — "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings."
**Content Direction:**

- Debunk the Galileo myth (more complex than "church vs. science")
- Christian assumptions that birthed science: rational God, ordered universe, humans capable of understanding
- Scientists who were believers: Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, Lemaitre (Big Bang)

---

### Day 17: What Science Can and Cannot Tell Us

**Key Question:** Does science disprove God?
**Main Thesis:** Science tells us how the physical world works, not why it exists or what we should do with that knowledge—those are philosophical and theological questions.
**Scripture Focus:** Job 38:4-7 — "Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation?"
**Content Direction:**

- Distinguish methodological naturalism from philosophical naturalism
- Science answers "how"; philosophy and theology answer "why" and "what for"
- The limits of scientism (self-defeating: the claim "only science gives knowledge" is not a scientific claim)

---

### Day 18: Miracles: Can They Happen?

**Key Question:** In a scientific age, can we believe in miracles?
**Main Thesis:** If God exists and created the natural order, He can certainly act within it—miracles are not violations of natural law but divine interventions.
**Scripture Focus:** Jeremiah 32:17 — "Nothing is too hard for you."
**Content Direction:**

- Define miracle: not "breaking" laws but God acting within His creation
- Address Hume's argument against miracles and its circular reasoning
- The resurrection as the central miracle: historical evidence approach

---

### Day 19: The Resurrection: Best Explanation of the Evidence

---

### Day 20: Invitation: Come and See

**Key Question:** What should I do with all this evidence?
**Main Thesis:** Evidence can take you to the threshold, but at some point you must step through—Jesus invites not just intellectual assent but personal encounter.
**Scripture Focus:** John 1:46 — "Come and see."
**Content Direction:**

- Move from apologetics to invitation
- The evidence is compelling, but faith is also relational
- Practical: How to take a first step (prayer, reading a Gospel, attending church)
- End with Jesus's own invitation: "Come to me, all who are weary"

---

- Why this difference matters for daily life

---

## Track 4: One Way, Many Questions (vs. Spirituality)

**Days:** 15
**Target:** "Spiritual but not religious," universalists, New Age seekers

---

### Day 1: Why We're All Spiritual

**Key Question:** What makes humans universally drawn to spirituality?
**Main Thesis:** The universal human search for transcendence, meaning, and connection points to something real beyond the material world.
**Scripture Focus:** Acts 17:27 — "God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him."
**Content Direction:**

- Statistics on "spiritual but not religious" demographic
- Modern story: someone who rejects religion but feels something deeper
- Validate the search while pointing to the Searcher

---

### Day 2: "Spiritual But Not Religious"

**Key Question:** What do people mean when they say they're spiritual but not religious?
**Main Thesis:** This common phrase reflects real dissatisfaction with institutional religion—but often leaves people without grounding or community.
**Scripture Focus:** Hebrews 10:25 — "Not giving up meeting together."
**Content Direction:**

- Unpack what people usually mean: private spirituality, personal experience, no institution
- Valid concerns: hypocrisy, abuse, rigidity in organized religion
- What's lost: community, accountability, tested tradition

---

### Day 3: The Problem with "All Paths Lead to God"

**Key Question:** Can all religions be equally true?
**Main Thesis:** The major religions make contradictory claims about fundamental reality—they can all be wrong, but they cannot all be right.
**Scripture Focus:** John 14:6 — "I am the way, the truth, and the life."
**Content Direction:**

- Logical law of non-contradiction
- Buddhism: no God, no self; Islam: one God, no Trinity; Christianity: Triune God
- Respect for other seekers doesn't require pretending they're all saying the same thing

---

### Day 4: Can Contradictions All Be True?

**Key Question:** Isn't it arrogant to say one religion is right and others are wrong?
**Main Thesis:** Claiming truth is not arrogance—it's honesty. Every worldview makes exclusive truth claims.
**Scripture Focus:** 2 Corinthians 11:4 — "If someone comes and proclaims another Jesus."
**Content Direction:**

- The elephant and the blind men: the story actually proves the opposite
- Even pluralism is a truth claim that excludes exclusivism
- The real question: What is actually true?

---

### Day 5: What Makes Christianity Unique?

**Key Question:** What does Christianity offer that no other religion does?
**Main Thesis:** Christianity alone offers a God who comes to us, takes our place, and offers salvation by grace—not a ladder we climb but a rescue from above.
**Scripture Focus:** Titus 3:5 — "He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy."
**Content Direction:**

- Contrast: works vs. grace, achievement vs. gift
- Incarnation: God becoming human is unique
- The cross: God taking the punishment is unique

---

### Day 6: The Scandal of Particularity

**Key Question:** Why would God reveal Himself through one nation, one person, one religion?
**Main Thesis:** God's particular revelation doesn't limit His love—it focuses it so all nations can receive it.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 12:3 — "All peoples on earth will be blessed through you."
**Content Direction:**

- Abraham: chosen not for exclusion but for blessing the nations
- Jesus: the particular person through whom universal salvation comes
- Analogy: a doctor helps everyone, but works through particular means

---

### Day 7: Grace: What No Other Religion Offers

**Key Question:** What is grace, and why is it unique to Christianity?
**Main Thesis:** In every religion except Christianity, the burden is on humans to reach up to God—only in Christianity does God reach down to us.
**Scripture Focus:** Ephesians 2:8-9 — "By grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing."
**Content Direction:**

- Hebrew: _chen_ (grace, favor); Greek: _charis_
- Survey other religions: all involve human effort earning divine favor
- Grace is not fair—and that's the point

---

### Day 8: What About Those Who Never Heard?

**Key Question:** Is it fair to condemn people who never had the opportunity to hear about Jesus?
**Main Thesis:** We can trust God's justice for those we don't know about—our responsibility is for those we do know about, starting with ourselves.
**Scripture Focus:** Romans 2:14-16 — "When Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law."
**Content Direction:**

- This is one of the hardest questions—don't pretend it's easy
- What we know: God is just, merciful, and will judge fairly
- Abraham's question: "Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?" (Gen 18:25)

---

### Day 9: Isn't Christianity Arrogant?

**Key Question:** Isn't it arrogant to claim Jesus is the only way to God?
**Main Thesis:** Christians aren't claiming to be better—we're claiming we found the lifeboat. Sharing a lifeboat isn't arrogance; it's love.
**Scripture Focus:** Acts 4:12 — "Salvation is found in no one else."
**Content Direction:**

- The arrogance objection: is it arrogant or loving?
- Christians claim to be rescued, not superior
- Analogy: Telling someone about a cure isn't arrogance

---

### Day 10: Can Good People Go to Hell?

**Key Question:** Would a loving God really send good people to hell?
**Main Thesis:** The question assumes our goodness is the standard—but compared to a holy God, none of us measure up. The real question is: What do we do with God's grace?
**Scripture Focus:** Romans 3:23 — "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
**Content Direction:**

- Define "good" by God's standard, not ours
- C.S. Lewis: Hell is the door locked from the inside
- Heaven is not a reward for good people; it's a gift for forgiven people

---

### Day 11: What About Sincere Believers in Other Faiths?

**Key Question:** If someone sincerely believes their religion, isn't that enough?
**Main Thesis:** Sincerity matters, but sincerity alone doesn't make something true—we can be sincerely wrong.
**Scripture Focus:** Proverbs 14:12 — "There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end it leads to death."
**Content Direction:**

- Sincerity is necessary but not sufficient
- A sincere belief in the wrong medicine doesn't heal you
- God honors the seeker—but the seeking must lead to finding (Jer 29:13)

---

### Day 12: Jesus: Liar, Lunatic, or Lord?

**Key Question:** Was Jesus just a good moral teacher, or something more?
**Main Thesis:** Jesus didn't leave us the option of calling Him merely a good teacher—His claims about Himself force a decision.
**Scripture Focus:** Mark 14:61-62 — "Are you the Messiah?" "I am."
**Content Direction:**

- C.S. Lewis's trilemma
- Jesus claimed divinity, forgiveness of sins, authority over all
- A "good teacher" wouldn't make such claims unless they were true

---

### Day 13: The Evidence Demands a Verdict

**Key Question:** What evidence supports Christianity's unique claims?
**Main Thesis:** Christianity is the most historically verifiable faith—its founder is the most documented figure of antiquity, and His resurrection is an event in history.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 Corinthians 15:6 — "He appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time."
**Content Direction:**

- Brief summary of historical evidence: manuscripts, archaeology, eyewitnesses
- The resurrection: the linchpin claim
- Christianity invites investigation, not blind faith

---

### Day 14: The Stories of Seekers

**Key Question:** Have spiritual seekers actually found Jesus?
**Main Thesis:** Countless people from non-Christian backgrounds have found their spiritual search ending in Christ—their stories are powerful testimony.
**Scripture Focus:** Matthew 7:7 — "Seek and you will find."
**Content Direction:**

- Multiple brief testimonies: New Age seeker, Buddhist, Hindu, atheist
- Common thread: Jesus found them when they were looking for "something more"
- Invitation to add your story

---

### Day 15: Why Jesus?

**Key Question:** Of all the options, why choose Jesus?
**Main Thesis:** Jesus answers the deepest longings of the human heart—for meaning, forgiveness, connection, and hope—in a way no other figure or philosophy can.
**Scripture Focus:** John 6:68 — "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life."
**Content Direction:**

- Summary of what makes Jesus unique: grace, incarnation, resurrection, presence
- Not just a teaching or system, but a person

**Days:** 15
**Target:** Those doubting Scripture's reliability

---

### Day 1: Why This Question Matters

**Key Question:** Why does the Bible's reliability matter so much?
**Main Thesis:** If the Bible is unreliable, Christianity crumbles. If it's reliable, we have a trustworthy revelation from God—the stakes couldn't be higher.
**Scripture Focus:** 2 Timothy 3:16 — "All Scripture is God-breathed."
**Content Direction:**

- Set the stakes honestly
- Story of someone who lost faith over doubts about Scripture—and someone who found faith through its reliability

**Content Direction:**

- Comparison: 5,800+ Greek NT manuscripts vs. Homer (1,800), Plato (200)
- Time gap: Earliest NT manuscripts within decades vs. centuries for other works
- This doesn't prove inspiration, but it proves transmission

---

### Day 4: How Copying Worked

**Key Question:** Didn't copying by hand introduce errors?
**Main Thesis:** While copyists made mistakes, the sheer number of manuscripts allows us to identify and correct errors—and no fundamental doctrine is affected.
**Scripture Focus:** Psalm 12:6 — "The words of the Lord are flawless."
**Content Direction:**

- How scribes copied: professional, meticulous, with checks
- Types of errors: spelling, word order, accidental omissions
- Textual criticism: comparing manuscripts to find the original

---

### Day 5: What About Textual Variants?

**Key Question:** Don't the differences between manuscripts prove the Bible is corrupted?
**Main Thesis:** The vast majority of variants are insignificant (spelling, word order), and none affect any essential Christian doctrine.
**Scripture Focus:** Isaiah 40:8 — "The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever."
**Content Direction:**

- Define "variant": any difference between manuscripts
- Most are trivial; less than 1% are meaningful; none affect doctrine
- Examples of significant variants and how scholars handle them

---

### Day 6: The Dead Sea Scrolls

**Key Question:** What do the Dead Sea Scrolls tell us about Old Testament reliability?
**Main Thesis:** The Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in 1947, pushed our Old Testament manuscripts back 1,000 years—and showed remarkable accuracy.
**Scripture Focus:** Isaiah 53:5 (found in Dead Sea Scrolls) — "He was pierced for our transgressions."
**Content Direction:**

- Discovery story: shepherd boy, caves, Qumran

**Main Thesis:** We have fragments from within a century of the originals—and complete manuscripts from the fourth century—making the NT exceptionally well-attested.
**Scripture Focus:** Luke 1:1-4 — "It seemed good to me also...to write an orderly account."
**Content Direction:**

- P52 (John fragment): c. 125 AD—within decades of composition
- Codex Sinaiticus, Vaticanus: 4th century complete Bibles
- Compare to other ancient works with centuries-long gaps

---

### Day 8: Did Jesus Really Exist?

**Key Question:** Is there evidence for Jesus outside the Bible?
**Main Thesis:** Non-Christian sources from the first two centuries confirm Jesus's existence, His followers, and His execution—virtually no serious historian doubts He existed.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 Corinthians 15:14 — "If Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless."
**Content Direction:**

- Tacitus (Annals 15.44): Christ, Pontius Pilate, crucifixion
- Josephus (Antiquities 18.63-64, 20.200): Jesus, James, Jewish historian
- Pliny the Younger: early Christians worshipping Christ "as to a god"

---

### Day 9: Are the Gospels Eyewitness Accounts?

**Key Question:** Were the Gospel writers in a position to know what happened?
**Main Thesis:** The Gospels show marks of eyewitness testimony—names, places, incidental details, embarrassing material—that fit genuine memory, not legend.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 John 1:1 — "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes."
**Content Direction:**

- Richard Bauckham's research on eyewitness names in Gospels
- Incidental details that serve no theological purpose
- Embarrassing admissions (disciples' failures, women as first witnesses)

---

### Day 10: When Were the Gospels Written?

**Key Question:** Were the Gospels written too late to be reliable?
**Main Thesis:** The Gospels were written within the lifetimes of eyewitnesses—too early for legend to develop and too close to events to be fabricated.
**Scripture Focus:** Luke 1:2 — "Just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses."
**Content Direction:**

- Dating the Gospels: Mark (50s-60s), Matthew/Luke (60s-80s), John (90s)
- 1 Corinthians 15:3-7: creedal formula dates to within years of crucifixion
- Legend takes generations; the Gospels appeared within decades

---

### Day 11: What About Contradictions?

**Key Question:** Doesn't the Bible contradict itself?
**Main Thesis:** Most alleged contradictions dissolve upon closer examination—and the remaining tensions often reflect multiple perspectives on real events, not fabrication.
**Scripture Focus:** John 21:25 — "Jesus did many other things as well."
**Content Direction:**

- Distinguish contradiction from complementarity
- Examples: genealogies (Matthew/Luke), resurrection accounts
- Variation is evidence of independence, not collusion

### Day 12: Archaeological Confirmation

**Key Question:** Does archaeology support or undermine the Bible?
**Main Thesis:** Archaeology has consistently confirmed biblical details—places, people, customs—that critics once dismissed as legendary.
**Scripture Focus:** Luke 3:1-2 — "In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar..."
**Content Direction:**

- Examples: Pool of Bethesda, Pilate inscription, Hezekiah's tunnel

---

### Day 14: The Bible's Unity

**Key Question:** How can 40 authors over 1,500 years produce one coherent story?
**Main Thesis:** The Bible's unity across time, culture, and genre points to a single divine Author behind the human authors.
**Scripture Focus:** Hebrews 1:1-2 — "In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets...now he has spoken to us by his Son."
**Content Direction:**

- Diversity: poetry, history, law, prophecy, gospel, letter

- The scarlet thread: Jesus is the hero of every part

---

### Day 15: Why It Matters

**Key Question:** So what? What difference does the Bible's reliability make?

**Content Direction:**

- Define the scientific method
- What science does well: physical mechanisms, predictions, technology
- Celebrate science as gift: medicine, communication, understanding

---

### Day 4: What Science Cannot Tell Us

**Key Question:** Are there questions science cannot answer?
**Main Thesis:** Science tells us how, not why; it describes facts, not values; it cannot address meaning, morality, or metaphysics.
**Scripture Focus:** Ecclesiastes 3:11 — "He has also set eternity in the human heart."
**Content Direction:**

- The limits of science: ethics, aesthetics, meaning, purpose
- The self-defeating nature of scientism
- Both science and faith address different questions—not competing answers to the same question

---

### Day 5: The Fine-Tuning of the Universe

**Content Direction:**

- Constants: gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear force
- The odds: life's existence hangs on knife-edge precision
- Multiverse response and its own faith-like assumptions

---

### Day 6: The Origin of Life

**Key Question:** Does science explain how life began?
**Main Thesis:** The origin of first life remains one of science's greatest unsolved mysteries—the leap from chemistry to biology is profound.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 2:7 — "The Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life."
**Content Direction:**

- Abiogenesis: the problem of life from non-life
- Miller-Urey experiment: what it showed and what it didn't
- Information and complexity: where does the code come from?

---

### Day 7: The Limits of Scientism

**Key Question:** Can science answer all questions worth asking?
**Main Thesis:** The claim that "only science gives knowledge" is not a scientific claim—scientism is a philosophical position that undercuts itself.
**Scripture Focus:** Colossians 2:8 — "See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy."
**Content Direction:**

- Define scientism vs. science
- The self-refuting nature of "only science gives knowledge"
- Science is wonderful; scientism is overreach

---

### Day 8: What About the Age of the Earth?

**Key Question:** Does the Bible require a young earth?
**Main Thesis:** Christians hold different views on the age of the earth—Young Earth, Old Earth, and others—and these are secondary issues, not core doctrine.
**Scripture Focus:** 2 Peter 3:8 — "With the Lord a day is like a thousand years."
**Content Direction:**

---

### Day 9: What About Evolution?

**Key Question:** Can a Christian accept evolution?
**Main Thesis:** Christians hold different views on evolution—some accept it, some reject it, some see it as God's method—and faithful believers disagree.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 1:24 — "Let the land produce living creatures."
**Content Direction:**

- Present views: Young Earth Creationism, Old Earth Creationism, Evolutionary Creation, Intelligent Design
- What all share: God is Creator, humans bear His image, Genesis speaks truth
- Distinguish mechanism (how) from meaning (why)

---

### Day 10: Adam and Eve: Historical or Literary?

**Key Question:** Were Adam and Eve real people?
**Main Thesis:** Views differ on whether Adam and Eve were historical individuals, representatives, or archetypes—but all affirm the theological truths Genesis teaches.
**Scripture Focus:** Romans 5:12 — "Sin entered the world through one man."
**Content Direction:**

- Why this matters: original sin, Paul's argument in Romans 5
- Views: historical pair, genealogical ancestors, archetypal figures
- What all affirm: human origin, sinfulness, need for salvation

---

### Day 11: Miracles and Natural Law

**Key Question:** How can miracles happen if nature follows laws?
**Main Thesis:** Natural laws describe what happens when God doesn't intervene—miracles are God acting within His creation, not violating it from outside.
**Scripture Focus:** Jeremiah 32:17 — "Ah, Sovereign Lord...nothing is too hard for you."
**Content Direction:**

- Define miracle: divine action within creation
- Hume's argument and its circular reasoning
- If God exists and created nature, He can act within it

---

### Day 12: The Resurrection: Historical, Not Anti-Scientific

**Key Question:** Is the resurrection scientifically impossible?
**Main Thesis:** The resurrection isn't a scientific claim but a historical one—the question isn't "do people naturally rise?" but "did Jesus actually rise?"
**Scripture Focus:** 1 Corinthians 15:17 — "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile."
**Content Direction:**

- Distinguish scientific laws from historical events
- The evidence: empty tomb, appearances, transformed disciples
- Science describes normal patterns; history can record exceptions

---

### Day 13: Mind, Brain, and Soul

**Key Question:** Does neuroscience disprove the soul?
**Main Thesis:** The brain clearly affects the mind, but this doesn't prove the mind is just the brain—consciousness remains deeply mysterious.

**Content Direction:**

- The hard problem of consciousness
- Correlation vs. causation: brain states and mental states
- Near-death experiences and their implications

---

### Day 14: Worshipping the Creator of Quarks and Quasars

**Key Question:** Does scientific knowledge enhance or diminish worship?
**Main Thesis:** The more we discover about the universe, the more reason we have to worship its Creator—science deepens wonder rather than destroying it.
**Scripture Focus:** Psalm 8:3-4 — "When I consider your heavens...what is mankind that you are mindful of them?"
**Content Direction:**

- Scale: from quantum to cosmic
- Quotes from scientists moved to worship
- Science as a form of studying God's handiwork

---

### Day 15: The Integration of All Truth

**Key Question:** How should Christians approach science going forward?
**Main Thesis:** All truth is God's truth—science and faith explore different dimensions of reality and ultimately integrate in the mind of God.
**Scripture Focus:** Colossians 1:17 — "In him all things hold together."
**Content Direction:**

- Both science and theology seek truth
- Humility in both: we don't have all answers
