## Track 1: How to Read the Bible

**Days:** 15
**Target:** All users, especially new believers and those confused by Scripture

---

### Day 1: The Bible Is Not a Fortune Cookie

**Key Question:** What kind of book is the Bible, and what kind isn't it?
**Main Thesis:** The Bible isn't a magic book of random verses for life decisions—it's a unified story that requires thoughtful reading.
**Scripture Focus:** 2 Timothy 2:15 — "Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who correctly handles the word of truth."
**Content Direction:**

- Common mistakes: flipping to random verses, proof-texting, reading out of context
- The Bible as a library: different genres, different reading strategies
- Set the vision: learning to read well changes everything

---

### Day 2: One Story, Many Books

**Key Question:** Is the Bible one book or many, and does it matter?
**Main Thesis:** The Bible is 66 books written over 1,500 years, yet tells one unified story—creation, fall, redemption, restoration.
**Scripture Focus:** Luke 24:27 — "Beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself."
**Content Direction:**

- Overview of the meta-narrative arc
- Hebrew: "Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim" — the Jewish organization
- The scarlet thread: Jesus is the hero of every part

---

### Day 3: Context Is King

**Key Question:** Why does context matter so much when reading the Bible?
**Main Thesis:** A text without a context is a pretext for whatever you want—understanding who wrote what, to whom, and why is essential.
**Scripture Focus:** Nehemiah 8:8 — "They read from the Book of the Law of God, making it clear and giving the meaning."
**Content Direction:**

- Historical context: What was happening when this was written?
- Literary context: What comes before and after?
- Canonical context: How does this fit the whole story?

---

### Day 4: Genres Matter

**Key Question:** Should poetry be read the same way as history?
**Main Thesis:** The Bible contains many genres—narrative, poetry, prophecy, wisdom, apocalyptic, epistle—and each has its own reading rules.
**Scripture Focus:** Psalm 119:105 — "Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path."
**Content Direction:**

- Overview of biblical genres with examples
- How to read poetry (metaphor, parallelism)
- How to read apocalyptic (symbolic, not newspaper)
- Common mistakes with genre confusion

---

### Day 5: Narrative: Stories That Teach

**Key Question:** How do we learn from biblical stories?
**Main Thesis:** Biblical narratives show rather than tell—they don't always prescribe what we should do, but describe what happened and invite reflection.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 Corinthians 10:11 — "These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us."
**Content Direction:**

- Descriptive vs. prescriptive
- Example: David and Goliath—what it's actually about
- Look for the narrator's perspective, repeated patterns, character development

---

### Day 6: Poetry: The Bible Sings

**Key Question:** Why is so much of the Bible poetry, and how do we read it?
**Main Thesis:** Poetry uses imagery, emotion, and parallelism to express truth in ways prose cannot—it's meant to be felt as well as understood.
**Scripture Focus:** Psalm 23:1 — "The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing."
**Content Direction:**

- Hebrew parallelism: synonymous, antithetical, synthetic
- Imagery and metaphor: shepherd, rock, fortress
- Reading Psalms as prayers and models of honest faith

---

### Day 7: Prophecy: Past, Present, and Future

**Key Question:** What are the prophets actually doing?
**Main Thesis:** Biblical prophecy is primarily "forth-telling" (speaking God's word to the present) rather than "fore-telling" (predicting the future).
**Scripture Focus:** Amos 5:24 — "Let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream."
**Content Direction:**

- The prophets as covenant prosecutors
- Pattern: indictment, judgment, hope
- How to read prophetic imagery (near/far fulfillment, already/not yet)

---

### Day 8: Wisdom Literature: Living Well

**Key Question:** How do Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job teach us to live?
**Main Thesis:** Wisdom literature offers observations about life—Proverbs gives general principles, Ecclesiastes questions easy answers, Job wrestles with suffering.
**Scripture Focus:** Proverbs 1:7 — "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge."
**Content Direction:**

- Proverbs: general truths, not absolute promises
- Ecclesiastes: the limits of human wisdom "under the sun"
- Job: when suffering doesn't fit the formula
- How the three work together

---

### Day 9: The Gospels: Four Portraits of One Person

**Key Question:** Why do we have four Gospels instead of one?
**Main Thesis:** The four Gospels are not contradictory biographies but complementary portraits—each emphasizes different aspects of Jesus for different audiences.
**Scripture Focus:** John 20:31 — "These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah."
**Content Direction:**

- Matthew: Jesus as King (Jewish audience)
- Mark: Jesus as Servant (Roman audience)
- Luke: Jesus as Savior of all (Gentile audience)
- John: Jesus as God (theological depth)

---

### Day 10: The Letters: Mail to Ancient Churches

**Key Question:** How do we apply letters written to specific ancient situations to our lives?
**Main Thesis:** The epistles were written to real churches with real problems—understanding their situation helps us apply their truths to ours.
**Scripture Focus:** 2 Peter 3:15-16 — "Paul also wrote to you with the wisdom that God gave him."
**Content Direction:**

- Occasional literature: written to specific occasions
- Steps: What did it mean to them? What's the principle? How does it apply?
- Common mistakes: skipping context, ignoring cultural distance

---

### Day 11: Apocalyptic: Revelation and Daniel

**Key Question:** How do we read the Bible's strangest books?
**Main Thesis:** Apocalyptic literature uses vivid symbolic imagery to reveal hidden truths about God's ultimate victory—it's meant to encourage, not confuse.
**Scripture Focus:** Revelation 1:3 — "Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy."
**Content Direction:**

- Genre characteristics: visions, symbols, cosmic conflict, divine triumph
- Symbols: beasts, numbers, colors (most have Old Testament roots)
- The point: God wins; persevere; don't fear

---

### Day 12: The PaRDeS Method: Four Levels

**Key Question:** How did ancient Jews read Scripture in layers?
**Main Thesis:** The PaRDeS method (Peshat, Remez, Derash, Sod) reveals multiple levels of meaning in Scripture—EUONGELION uses this framework.
**Scripture Focus:** Psalm 119:18 — "Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law."
**Content Direction:**

- Peshat: Plain, literal meaning
- Remez: Hint, deeper significance
- Derash: Explore, practical application
- Sod: Hidden, mystical meaning
- How EUONGELION devotionals use this structure

---

### Day 13: Jesus Is the Key

**Key Question:** How is Jesus central to understanding all of Scripture?
**Main Thesis:** Jesus claimed all Scripture pointed to Him—reading with Christ at the center transforms how we understand every book.
**Scripture Focus:** John 5:39 — "You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me."
**Content Direction:**

- Jesus's claim: Moses wrote about Me (John 5:46)

- Example: How the Exodus points to Jesus

---

### Day 14: The Holy Spirit: Your Teacher

**Key Question:** What role does the Holy Spirit play in understanding Scripture?
**Main Thesis:** The same Spirit who inspired Scripture illuminates it—Bible study is not just intellectual but spiritual.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 Corinthians 2:12-14 — "We have received...the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand."
**Content Direction:**

- Illumination: The Spirit helps us understand and apply
- This doesn't replace study—it enhances it
- Posture: humble, prayerful, teachable

---

### Day 15: Now Go Read

**Key Question:** How do I put all this into practice?
**Main Thesis:** Reading the Bible well is a skill that develops over time—start simple, stay consistent, and expect to grow.
**Scripture Focus:** James 1:22 — "Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says."
**Content Direction:**

- Practical plan: choose a book, read in context, ask questions
- Tools: good translation, study Bible, commentaries
- The goal: not just information but transformation
- Invitation: Let's begin the journey together

---

## Track 2: What We Believe (Systematic Doctrine)

**Days:** 20
**Target:** All believers wanting deeper theological grounding

---

### Day 1: Why Doctrine Matters

**Key Question:** Isn't it enough to just love Jesus without worrying about theology?
**Main Thesis:** Doctrine is simply what we believe about God—everyone has theology; the question is whether it's true.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 Timothy 4:16 — "Watch your life and doctrine closely."
**Content Direction:**

- Doctrine = teaching; theology = study of God
- You can't love someone you don't know
- Bad theology leads to bad living (examples)

---

### Day 2: God Exists

**Key Question:** How do we know God is real?
**Main Thesis:** The existence of God is supported by philosophical arguments, the existence of the universe, and the human experience of meaning, morality, and beauty.
**Scripture Focus:** Romans 1:20 — "Since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities...have been clearly seen."
**Content Direction:**

- Cosmological: Why is there something rather than nothing?
- Teleological: Why is there design?
- Moral: Why is there a sense of right and wrong?
- General revelation vs. special revelation

---

### Day 3: God Is One

**Key Question:** Is Christianity monotheistic?
**Main Thesis:** Christianity is strictly monotheistic—there is only one God, though He exists eternally in three persons.
**Scripture Focus:** Deuteronomy 6:4 — "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one."
**Content Direction:**

- Hebrew: "Shema"—the central Jewish confession
- Christianity affirms: one God, one Being, one divine nature
- Distinguish from polytheism, henotheism, pantheism

---

### Day 4: God Is Three

**Key Question:** How can God be one and three at the same time?
**Main Thesis:** The Trinity is one God in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—not three gods and not one person wearing three masks.
**Scripture Focus:** Matthew 28:19 — "Baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
**Content Direction:**

- Biblical basis: Father is God, Son is God, Spirit is God; yet one God
- Not tritheism (three gods) or modalism (one person, three roles)
- The Trinity is mystery, not contradiction
- Practical: We are loved by the Father, saved by the Son, empowered by the Spirit

---

### Day 5: God's Character: Holy and Loving

**Key Question:** What is God actually like?
**Main Thesis:** God is both perfectly holy (set apart, pure) and perfectly loving (self-giving, merciful)—and these are not in tension.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 John 4:8 — "God is love." / Isaiah 6:3 — "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty."
**Content Direction:**

- Holiness: transcendence, purity, "otherness"
- Love: not sentimentality but covenant commitment
- The cross as the meeting place of holiness and love

---

### Day 6: God Is Sovereign

**Key Question:** Is God in control of everything?
**Main Thesis:** God is sovereign over all things—nothing happens outside His knowledge or permission—yet He holds humans responsible for their choices.
**Scripture Focus:** Daniel 4:35 — "He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth."
**Content Direction:**

- Sovereignty: God rules over all creation
- Mystery: human freedom and divine sovereignty (don't resolve the tension)
- Comfort: nothing is outside God's plan; nothing takes Him by surprise

---

### Day 7: Creation: God Made Everything

**Key Question:** What does it mean that God is Creator?
**Main Thesis:** God created everything that exists out of nothing—the universe is not eternal, self-existent, or divine, but dependent on God.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 1:1 — "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."
**Content Direction:**

- Hebrew: "bara" — create from nothing (only God as subject)
- Implications: creation is good, purposeful, meaningful
- We are creatures, not accidents—image-bearers of the Creator

---

### Day 8: Humanity: Image Bearers

**Key Question:** What makes humans unique and valuable?
**Main Thesis:** Humans are made in God's image (_imago Dei_)—we bear His likeness and have inherent dignity, value, and purpose.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 1:27 — "God created mankind in his own image."
**Content Direction:**

- Hebrew: "tselem" (image) and "demut" (likeness)
- What it means: rationality, morality, relationality, creativity, dominion
- Implications for human dignity, ethics, purpose

---

### Day 9: The Fall: What Went Wrong

**Key Question:** Why is the world so broken?
**Main Thesis:** Human rebellion against God—sin—brought death, corruption, and alienation into the world; we are not as we were meant to be.
**Scripture Focus:** Romans 5:12 — "Sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin."
**Content Direction:**

- Genesis 3: the serpent, the choice, the consequences
- Total depravity: not as bad as possible, but affected in every part
- The need for rescue: we cannot save ourselves

---

### Day 10: Sin: Missing the Mark

**Key Question:** What exactly is sin?
**Main Thesis:** Sin is not just bad behavior but rebellion against God, falling short of His glory, and choosing our way over His.
**Scripture Focus:** Romans 3:23 — "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
**Content Direction:**

- Hebrew: "chata" (miss the mark); Greek: "hamartia"
- Sin as commission and omission
- Sin as relational rupture, not just rule-breaking

---

### Day 11: Jesus: Fully God

**Key Question:** Why does it matter that Jesus is God?
**Main Thesis:** Only God can save; if Jesus is not divine, He cannot bear the infinite weight of human sin or reconcile us to the Father.
**Scripture Focus:** Colossians 2:9 — "In Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form."
**Content Direction:**

- Biblical evidence: Jesus's divine claims, worship, attributes
- Early church councils: Nicaea affirmed "true God from true God"
- Why it matters: a mere man cannot save; only God can bridge the gap

---

### Day 12: Jesus: Fully Human

**Key Question:** Why does it matter that Jesus is human?
**Main Thesis:** Only a human can represent humanity; if Jesus is not fully human, He cannot be our substitute or our example.
**Scripture Focus:** Hebrews 2:17 — "He had to be made like them, fully human in every way."
**Content Direction:**

- Biblical evidence: birth, growth, hunger, thirst, tears, death
- Why it matters: He represents us, substitutes for us, sympathizes with us
- The incarnation: God entered our story

---

### Day 13: The Atonement: How Jesus Saves

**Key Question:** How does Jesus's death actually save us?
**Main Thesis:** On the cross, Jesus took our place, bore our punishment, and conquered the powers of sin and death—multiple metaphors capture this rich reality.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 Peter 3:18 — "Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God."
**Content Direction:**

- Substitutionary atonement: He died in our place
- Propitiation: He satisfied God's wrath
- Ransom: He paid the price
- Victory: He defeated Satan, sin, and death

---

### Day 14: The Resurrection: Victory Over Death

**Key Question:** Why is the resurrection essential to Christianity?
**Main Thesis:** Without the resurrection, there is no Christianity—it validates Jesus's claims, secures our forgiveness, and guarantees our future.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 Corinthians 15:17 — "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins."
**Content Direction:**

- Historical reality: empty tomb, appearances, transformed disciples
- Theological significance: vindication, justification, firstfruits
- Future hope: because He lives, we will live

---

### Day 15: Salvation: By Grace Through Faith

**Key Question:** How are we saved?
**Main Thesis:** Salvation is entirely a gift from God—we receive it by grace (God's unmerited favor) through faith (trusting Christ), not by our works.
**Scripture Focus:** Ephesians 2:8-9 — "By grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God."
**Content Direction:**

- Grace: undeserved favor
- Faith: trusting Christ, not just believing facts
- Not works: we cannot earn it; we receive it
- The ordo salutis: calling, regeneration, faith, justification, sanctification, glorification

---

### Day 16: The Holy Spirit: God With Us

**Key Question:** Who is the Holy Spirit and what does He do?
**Main Thesis:** The Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity—fully God—who indwells believers, empowers the church, and continues Christ's work.
**Scripture Focus:** John 14:16-17 — "I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate...the Spirit of truth."
**Content Direction:**

- The Spirit is a person, not a force
- The Spirit's work: conviction, regeneration, indwelling, empowering, gifting
- Life in the Spirit: walk, keep step, be filled

---

### Day 17: The Church: The Body of Christ

**Key Question:** What is the church and why does it matter?
**Main Thesis:** The church is not a building but a people—the gathered community of believers who are Christ's body on earth.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 Corinthians 12:27 — "Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it."
**Content Direction:**

- Greek: "ekklesia" — the called-out assembly
- Universal church and local church
- Marks of the church: Word, sacraments, discipline, mission
- Why church matters: you can't follow Jesus alone

---

### Day 18: Baptism and Communion

**Key Question:** What are the sacraments and why do we practice them?
**Main Thesis:** Baptism and the Lord's Supper are visible signs of invisible grace—given by Christ to the church as means of remembrance and nourishment.
**Scripture Focus:** Matthew 28:19 — "Baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." / 1 Corinthians 11:24 — "Do this in remembrance of me."
**Content Direction:**

- Baptism: sign of cleansing, union with Christ, entrance into covenant community
- Communion: remembrance, proclamation, nourishment, anticipation
- Different traditions, shared core

---

### Day 19: The Return of Christ

**Key Question:** What do we believe about the future?
**Main Thesis:** Jesus promised to return—bodily, visibly, gloriously—to judge the living and the dead and to make all things new.
**Scripture Focus:** Acts 1:11 — "This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way."
**Content Direction:**

- Jesus's promise: "I will come again" (John 14:3)
- Signs of the times: be watchful, not calculating
- Different views on timing (premil, amil, postmil)—but agreement on the fact

---

### Day 20: New Creation: The End of the Story

**Key Question:** What is the final hope of Christianity?
**Main Thesis:** The Bible's hope is not escape from creation but its renewal—resurrection bodies in a new heaven and new earth, God dwelling with His people forever.
**Scripture Focus:** Revelation 21:5 — "He who was seated on the throne said, 'I am making everything new!'"
**Content Direction:**

- Not souls floating in clouds but resurrected bodies in renewed creation
- The tree of life returns; the curse is lifted
- No more death, mourning, crying, or pain
- The story ends where it began—God with His people—but better

---

## Track 3: Hard Doctrines

**Days:** 5
**Target:** Believers wrestling with difficult biblical teachings

---

### Day 1: Hell: Does It Exist?

**Key Question:** Would a loving God send people to hell?
**Main Thesis:** Hell is a real and terrible consequence of rejecting God—but it's also self-chosen; God doesn't send people there against their will.
**Scripture Focus:** Matthew 25:46 — "Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."
**Content Direction:**

- Jesus spoke more about hell than anyone
- C.S. Lewis: Hell is the door locked from the inside
- Three views: eternal conscious punishment, annihilationism, conditionalism
- Pastoral: This should drive us to compassion, not complacency

---

### Day 2: Predestination: Does God Choose?

**Key Question:** If God predestines, do we have free will?
**Main Thesis:** The Bible teaches both divine sovereignty and human responsibility—this is mystery to embrace, not a problem to solve.
**Scripture Focus:** Ephesians 1:4-5 — "He chose us in him before the creation of the world."
**Content Direction:**

- Predestination in Scripture: Romans 8:29, Ephesians 1, Acts 13:48
- Two main views: Calvinism (unconditional election) vs. Arminianism (conditional election)
- Both affirm: God saves; humans choose; the mystery is real
- Pastoral: Predestination is for comfort (security), not speculation

---

### Day 3: Suffering: Why Does God Allow It?

**Key Question:** Why does God allow suffering in the world?
**Main Thesis:** Suffering is the hardest question—and Christianity doesn't fully answer "why" but offers presence, meaning, and ultimate hope.
**Scripture Focus:** Romans 8:28 — "In all things God works for the good of those who love him."
**Content Direction:**

- Types of suffering: moral evil, natural evil, spiritual warfare
- What we know: God grieves with us; Jesus suffered too; suffering is temporary
- What we don't know: the specific "why" for each person
- The cross as God's answer: not explanation but presence

---

### Day 4: Exclusivity: Is Jesus the Only Way?

**Key Question:** How can Christians claim Jesus is the only way to God?
**Main Thesis:** Jesus's claim to exclusivity is not arrogance but honesty—He didn't say He knew the way; He said He is the way.
**Scripture Focus:** John 14:6 — "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."
**Content Direction:**

- This is Jesus's claim, not Christians' invention
- The scandal of particularity: why would God work through one person?
- Responding with humility: we didn't make this rule; we're sharing what Jesus said
- What about those who never heard? Trust God's justice; do your part

---

### Day 5: The Trinity: One and Three

**Key Question:** How can God be one and three simultaneously?
**Main Thesis:** The Trinity is mysterious but not contradictory—one what (being/essence), three whos (persons)—and it lies at the heart of Christian faith.
**Scripture Focus:** 2 Corinthians 13:14 — "May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."
**Content Direction:**

- Why this matters: salvation involves all three persons
- Historical development: Councils responding to heresies
- Analogies and their limits (none are perfect)
- Worship: the Trinity is not a puzzle to solve but a God to adore

---

## Conclusion

These 40 days of doctrinal content ground believers in the foundations of the faith. The goal is not merely information transfer but formation—knowing God, not just knowing about God.

Doctrinal teaching should be:

- **Biblical:** Rooted in Scripture, not speculation
- **Historical:** Connected to the church through the ages
- **Practical:** Applied to real life
- **Doxological:** Leading to worship
