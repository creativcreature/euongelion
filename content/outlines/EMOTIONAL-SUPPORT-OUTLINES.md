---

### Day 1: You're Not Alone in This

**Key Question:** Is it okay for a Christian to struggle with anxiety?
**Main Thesis:** Anxiety is one of the most common human experiences—even people of great faith have wrestled with it. Your struggle is not a sign of weak faith.
**Scripture Focus:** Matthew 6:25 — "Do not worry about your life."
**Content Direction:**

- Normalize anxiety: statistics, biblical figures who struggled (Elijah, David, Paul)
- Jesus wouldn't have said "do not worry" if His followers weren't prone to it
- Set the tone: this series is for walking with you, not lecturing you

---

### Day 2: What Anxiety Actually Is

**Key Question:** What is happening in my body and mind when I'm anxious?
**Main Thesis:** Anxiety is a God-given warning system that has misfired—understanding its purpose helps us respond to it wisely.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 Peter 5:7 — "Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you."
**Content Direction:**

- The biology: fight-or-flight, amygdala, cortisol
- The purpose: fear is protective; anxiety is fear misapplied
- The invitation: God doesn't shame anxiety; He invites us to bring it to Him

---

### Day 3: The God Who Knows Your Fears

**Key Question:** Does God understand what anxiety feels like?
**Main Thesis:** Jesus experienced extreme distress in Gethsemane—sweating blood, begging the Father—He knows the weight you carry.
**Scripture Focus:** Luke 22:44 — "Being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood."
**Content Direction:**

- Gethsemane: Jesus's own experience of extreme emotional distress

---

### Day 4: "Do Not Worry" — What Jesus Actually Meant

**Key Question:** Is "don't worry" a command or an invitation?
**Main Thesis:** Jesus's words in Matthew 6 are not a rebuke but a gentle invitation to consider how the Father cares for you.
**Scripture Focus:** Matthew 6:26-30 — "Look at the birds of the air...your heavenly Father feeds them."
**Content Direction:**

- Greek: "merimnao" (anxious care, divided mind)
- Jesus's method: redirect attention to the Father's care
- Not "try harder to not worry" but "look at who your Father is"

---

### Day 5: The Lies Anxiety Tells

**Key Question:** What false narratives fuel our anxiety?
**Main Thesis:** Anxiety is often built on lies—that we're alone, that the worst will happen, that we can't handle it—and truth is the antidote.

**Content Direction:**

- Common anxiety lies: "I'm alone," "I can't cope," "Something terrible will happen"

- Practice: identify the lie, speak the truth

### Day 6: Peace That Doesn't Make Sense

**Key Question:** What is the peace that surpasses understanding?
**Main Thesis:** God offers a peace that defies circumstances—not the absence of problems but the presence of God in the midst of them.
**Scripture Focus:** Philippians 4:7 — "The peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds."

- How to access it: the context of Philippians 4:6-7 (prayer with thanksgiving)

---

### Day 7: The Philippians 4 Pattern

**Key Question:** What practical steps does Paul give for dealing with anxiety?
**Main Thesis:** Paul offers a concrete pattern: be anxious for nothing, pray about everything, with thanksgiving—and peace will follow.

- Step 3: With thanksgiving (gratitude shifts focus)
- Result: Peace guards your heart

---

### Day 8: When Anxiety Feels Like a Storm

**Key Question:** How do I find Jesus in the middle of panic?
**Main Thesis:** The disciples panicked in the storm while Jesus slept—He is Lord over the chaos, and His presence is available in your storm.
**Scripture Focus:** Mark 4:39-40 — "He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, 'Quiet! Be still!'"
**Content Direction:**

- The storm narrative: disciples' terror, Jesus's calm

- Jesus is in the boat with you; He has not abandoned you

---

### Day 10: The Discipline of Present Moment

**Key Question:** Why does anxiety pull us to the future, and how do we return to now?
**Main Thesis:** Anxiety lives in the future; grace lives in the present. The practice of presence brings us back to the only moment where God can be found.
**Scripture Focus:** Matthew 6:34 — "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself."
**Content Direction:**

- Anxiety is always about "what if" (future)

---

---

### Day 12: The Gift of Lament

- The principle: past faithfulness predicts future faithfulness

---

### Day 14: When Anxiety Is Chronic

**Key Question:** What if anxiety never fully goes away?
**Main Thesis:** Some anxiety is chronic—and God's grace is sufficient for ongoing struggles, not just one-time healing.
**Scripture Focus:** 2 Corinthians 12:9 — "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."
**Content Direction:**

- Paul's thorn: he asked for healing three times; God gave grace instead

- Permission: it's okay if this is a lifelong companion that you manage

---

### Day 15: The Role of Professional Help

**Scripture Focus:** Proverbs 19:21 — "Many are the plans in a person's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose that prevails."
**Content Direction:**

- Control as coping mechanism: why it feels safe

---

### Day 17: Community in Anxiety

---

---

### Day 9: The First Year

- Keeping some things is okay; releasing is okay too

---

### Day 12: Guilt and "What Ifs"

**Key Question:** How do I deal with regrets and guilt after someone dies?

---

### Day 13: Helping Others Understand

---

### Day 14: The Ongoing Relationship

**Key Question:** Is it okay to still talk to them or feel connected?
**Main Thesis:** Death ends a life but not a relationship—the person you lost remains part of your story, and it's okay to maintain that bond.

---

### Day 17: Children and Grief

**Key Question:** How do I help children grieve, or how do I process childhood loss?

---

### Day 9: When Theology Doesn't Work

**Key Question:** Why don't the answers I've been given satisfy?

**Content Direction:**

- Anger implies relationship, expectation, trust betrayed
- Atheists don't get angry at a God they don't believe in
- Your anger is evidence of connection, not disconnection

---

### Day 12: The Danger of Bitterness

**Key Question:** When does righteous anger become destructive bitterness?
**Main Thesis:** Anger acknowledged and brought to God can heal; anger nursed and hidden becomes a root of bitterness that poisons the soul.

---

### Day 14: When You Want to Walk Away

**Scripture Focus:** John 6:68 — "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life."
**Content Direction:**

- Acknowledge: you've thought about leaving
