## Track 1: Creation and Fall

**Days:** 10
**Target:** All believers wanting meta-narrative understanding
**Tagline:** The story begins with beauty and breaks into tragedy. But it doesn't end there.

---

### Day 1: In the Beginning, God

**Key Question:** What does Genesis 1:1 tell us about reality?
**Main Thesis:** The first four words of the Bible—"In the beginning, God"—establish the foundational truth of all existence: God precedes and creates everything that is.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 1:1 — "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."
**Content Direction:**

- Hebrew: "Bereshit bara Elohim"—in beginning, created, God
- Against ancient alternatives: chaos, chance, eternal matter
- The God who speaks reality into existence
- This is where the story begins: not with us, but with Him

---

### Day 2: Creation: A World of Order and Beauty

**Key Question:** What kind of world did God create?
**Main Thesis:** God created a world of order from chaos, beauty from void, life from nothing—and He declared it all "very good."
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 1:31 — "God saw all that he had made, and it was very good."
**Content Direction:**

- The structure: chaos → order → abundance
- The refrain: "And God saw that it was good" (seven times)
- Creation by word: God speaks and it is
- The goodness of material creation: against gnostic devaluation

---

### Day 3: Made in the Image

**Key Question:** What makes humans unique in all creation?
**Main Thesis:** Humans alone are made in God's image—bearing His likeness, representing His rule, and possessing inherent dignity that nothing else in creation shares.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 1:26-27 — "Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness."
**Content Direction:**

- Hebrew: "tselem" (image) and "demut" (likeness)
- What it means: rationality, relationality, creativity, morality, dominion
- Male and female: both equally image-bearers
- Implications: every human life has infinite value

---

### Day 4: The Garden: Temple and Home

**Key Question:** What was Eden, and what does it reveal about God's intentions?
**Main Thesis:** Eden was both garden and temple—a place where heaven met earth, where God walked with humanity, and where we were meant to dwell forever.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 2:8-9 — "The Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden."
**Content Direction:**

- Eden as sacred space: temple imagery throughout
- River flowing out: like Ezekiel's temple vision
- Tree of life: access to God's eternal presence
- The vocation: "to work it and take care of it"—priestly language

---

### Day 5: Created for Relationship

**Key Question:** Why did God say "it is not good for man to be alone"?
**Main Thesis:** God created us for relationship—with Him and with one another. The first "not good" was isolation, and the remedy was community.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 2:18 — "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."
**Content Direction:**

- The only "not good" in a good creation
- Hebrew: "ezer kenegdo" (helper corresponding to him)—not inferior
- Marriage as the first human institution
- We are relational because God is relational (Trinity)

---

### Day 6: The Tree and the Choice

**Key Question:** Why did God put a forbidden tree in the garden?
**Main Thesis:** The tree of knowledge represented choice—without a genuine option to disobey, obedience would be meaningless. Love requires freedom.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 2:16-17 — "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil."
**Content Direction:**

- Freedom requires limits; love requires choice
- The tree as opportunity for genuine relationship
- "Knowledge of good and evil"—autonomy, deciding for oneself
- God gave one prohibition amid abundant permission

---

### Day 7: The Serpent's Lie

**Key Question:** How did the serpent deceive Eve, and how does he deceive us?
**Main Thesis:** The serpent's strategy was to question God's word, impugn God's character, and minimize the consequences. The same lies work today.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 3:1 — "Did God really say...?"
**Content Direction:**

- Three tactics: doubt the word ("Did God really say?"), question the character ("God knows..."), minimize consequences ("You will not surely die")
- The serpent's portrait of God: stingy, threatened, dishonest
- The appeal: "You will be like God"—already true, but twisted
- How these lies still work on us

---

### Day 8: The Fall: Everything Breaks

**Key Question:** What exactly happened when Adam and Eve sinned?
**Main Thesis:** In eating the fruit, Adam and Eve chose autonomy over trust, and everything fractured—relationship with God, with each other, with creation, and within themselves.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 3:6-7 — "She took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it."
**Content Direction:**

- The choice: trust God or be your own god
- Immediate effects: shame, hiding, blame
- Four fractures: vertical (God), horizontal (each other), internal (self), ecological (creation)
- The first question in fallen history: "Where are you?"

---

### Day 9: The Curses and the Promise

**Key Question:** How did God respond to human rebellion?
**Main Thesis:** God's response to the Fall included judgment—but woven through the curses was a promise. The seed of the woman would crush the serpent's head.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 3:15 — "He will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."
**Content Direction:**

- Curse on the serpent: crawling, enmity, ultimate defeat
- The "protoevangelium": the first gospel promise
- Curses on man and woman: pain, toil, death
- Even in judgment, grace: God clothed them

---

### Day 10: East of Eden: Sin Spreads

**Key Question:** What happened after the Fall?
**Main Thesis:** Genesis 4-11 shows sin spreading like cancer—Cain murders Abel, wickedness fills the earth, Babel tries to storm heaven. The problem is deeper than behavior; it's the human heart.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 6:5 — "The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth."
**Content Direction:**

- Cain and Abel: the first murder
- Lamech: escalating violence and boasting
- Noah: judgment and grace; flood and covenant
- Babel: humanity unified against God
- The setup: humanity needs rescue it cannot provide

---

## Track 2: The Promise

**Days:** 15
**Target:** All believers
**Tagline:** One family. One promise. The hope of all nations.

---

### Day 1: The Call of Abram

**Key Question:** Why did God choose Abram, and what did He promise?
**Main Thesis:** Out of all the nations scattered at Babel, God chose one man to bless all nations. Abram's call is the beginning of the rescue mission.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 12:1-3 — "I will bless you...and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you."
**Content Direction:**

- Context: after Babel's disaster, God doesn't abandon humanity
- The call: leave everything you know; go to I'll-show-you
- The promise: land, offspring, blessing to all nations
- This is the lens for the rest of the Bible

---

### Day 2: Faith Counted as Righteousness

**Key Question:** How was Abram made right with God?
**Main Thesis:** Abram believed God's promise, and God counted it as righteousness—not through works or merit, but through faith. This is the gospel before the gospel.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 15:6 — "Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness."
**Content Direction:**

- The promise repeated: offspring like the stars
- Abram's response: he believed
- God's response: credited as righteousness
- Paul's commentary: this is how salvation has always worked (Romans 4)

---

### Day 3: Covenant: God Binds Himself

**Key Question:** What is a covenant, and why does it matter?
**Main Thesis:** God made a covenant with Abram—a binding, unbreakable promise sealed in blood. God committed Himself to fulfill what Abram couldn't guarantee.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 15:17-18 — "A smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces."
**Content Direction:**

- Ancient covenant ritual: animals split, parties walk between
- The stunning twist: only God passed through
- Meaning: God takes both sides; He guarantees fulfillment
- Unconditional promise: God will do this

---

### Day 4: Hagar and Ishmael: Human Solutions

**Key Question:** What happens when we try to help God fulfill His promises?
**Main Thesis:** When Sarai gave Hagar to Abram, they tried to fulfill God's promise their way. Human solutions to divine problems create complications, not resolution.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 16:2 — "The Lord has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her."
**Content Direction:**

- The logic: God is slow; we'll help
- The result: conflict, pain, unintended consequences
- Ishmael is blessed but not the child of promise
- Lesson: God's timing and God's way matter

---

### Day 5: Abraham and Sarah: New Names, Same Promise

**Key Question:** Why did God change Abram and Sarai's names?
**Main Thesis:** New names signal new identity—Abram (exalted father) becomes Abraham (father of many); Sarai becomes Sarah. The promise of offspring is renewed as impossible as it looks.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 17:5 — "No longer will you be called Abram; your name will be Abraham."
**Content Direction:**

- Name changes in Scripture: identity transformation
- Abraham: "father of many"—still childless at 99
- The promise repeated: nations, kings, everlasting covenant
- Circumcision: the sign of the covenant in the flesh

---

### Day 6: Isaac: Laughter Born

**Key Question:** What does Isaac's birth teach us about God's promises?
**Main Thesis:** Isaac's birth was humanly impossible—Sarah was 90, Abraham was 100. Yet nothing is too hard for the Lord, and he who promised is faithful.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 21:1-3 — "Now the Lord was gracious to Sarah as he had said...Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age."
**Content Direction:**

- The years of waiting: 25 years from promise to fulfillment
- Sarah's laughter: from skepticism to joy
- Isaac means "he laughs"—the child of impossible promise
- Pattern: God often waits until human impossibility to show His power

---

### Day 7: Mount Moriah: The Testing

**Key Question:** Why did God ask Abraham to sacrifice Isaac?
**Main Thesis:** The binding of Isaac was the ultimate test of faith—would Abraham trust God even when the command seemed to contradict the promise?
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 22:2 — "Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and sacrifice him."
**Content Direction:**

- The terrible command: sacrifice the promised son
- Abraham's faith: "God himself will provide the lamb"
- The substitute: a ram caught in the thicket
- Foreshadowing: the Father who would not spare His only Son

---

### Day 8: Rebekah: The Promise Continues

**Key Question:** How does Isaac's marriage continue the promise line?
**Main Thesis:** Abraham sent his servant to find a wife for Isaac, trusting God to guide. Rebekah's coming shows God's faithfulness across generations.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 24:27 — "The Lord...has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master."
**Content Direction:**

- Abraham's concern: the promise must continue through proper lineage
- The servant's prayer and God's answer
- Rebekah's choice: she agrees to go
- The promise line continues: faith is passed to the next generation

---

### Day 9: Jacob and Esau: The Unlikely Chosen

**Key Question:** Why did God choose Jacob over Esau?
**Main Thesis:** God chose Jacob—the deceiver, the younger, the grasper—over Esau. God's election is not based on merit but on His mysterious purposes.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 25:23 — "The older will serve the younger."
**Content Direction:**

- The struggle in the womb: already in conflict
- God's declaration: the younger will prevail (contra culture)
- Jacob's character: scheming, grasping, deceiving
- God's pattern: choosing the unlikely, working through the broken

---

### Day 10: Jacob's Ladder: Heaven Meets Earth

**Key Question:** What did Jacob's dream reveal about God?
**Main Thesis:** Jacob saw a ladder connecting heaven and earth with God standing above—a promise that the covenant blessing would continue through him despite his character.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 28:12-13 — "He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven."
**Content Direction:**

- The setting: fleeing from Esau, alone, afraid
- The vision: a stairway (or ramp), angels ascending and descending
- God's promise: same as Abraham and Isaac
- Jesus's interpretation: "You will see heaven open" (John 1:51)

---

### Day 11: Wrestling with God

**Key Question:** What happened when Jacob wrestled with God?
**Main Thesis:** Jacob wrestled all night with God and was both wounded and blessed—renamed Israel, "one who struggles with God." His limp became his identity.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 32:28 — "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome."
**Content Direction:**

- The context: facing Esau after decades of estrangement
- The nighttime stranger: God in human form?
- The wound and the blessing: hip dislocated, name changed
- The limp: Jacob walked differently ever after

---

### Day 12: Joseph: Favored and Hated

**Key Question:** Why did Joseph's brothers hate him?
**Main Thesis:** Joseph was his father's favorite, and his brothers' jealousy led to betrayal. But God's providence was already weaving a rescue plan.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 37:4 — "When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him."
**Content Direction:**

- The coat: visible favoritism
- The dreams: apparent arrogance
- The betrayal: sold into slavery, reported dead
- The providence: this is not random; God is working

---

### Day 13: Joseph: Suffering and Rise

**Key Question:** How did God work through Joseph's suffering?
**Main Thesis:** Joseph suffered—slavery, false accusation, prison—yet God was with him at every stage, positioning him to save many lives.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 39:21 — "The Lord was with Joseph and showed him kindness."
**Content Direction:**

- In Potiphar's house: success, then false accusation
- In prison: faithful service, forgotten by the cupbearer
- The pattern: suffering, faithfulness, promotion
- "The Lord was with him"—repeated refrain

---

### Day 14: Joseph: Redemption and Reconciliation

**Key Question:** How did Joseph respond to his brothers?
**Main Thesis:** Joseph could have taken revenge—instead, he revealed himself with tears and interpreted his suffering through the lens of God's providence.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 50:20 — "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives."
**Content Direction:**

- The reunion: brothers unknowingly before the one they betrayed
- Joseph's tears: grief, longing, and forgiveness
- The reinterpretation: what you meant for evil, God meant for good
- Forgiveness that flows from seeing God's hand

---

### Day 15: The Promise Preserved

**Key Question:** How does Genesis end, and what does it anticipate?
**Main Thesis:** Genesis ends with coffins in Egypt—but it also ends with hope. The promise to Abraham survives, and Joseph's bones will eventually go home.
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 50:24-25 — "God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place."
**Content Direction:**

- The family in Egypt: protected but displaced
- Joseph's deathbed faith: God will visit you
- The bones: carried out in the Exodus, buried in the Promised Land
- The promise endures: Abraham's descendants are now a people

---

## Track 3: Exodus and Wilderness

**Days:** 15
**Target:** All believers
**Tagline:** God heard their cry. He hears yours too.

---

### Day 1: A New King Who Knew Not Joseph

**Key Question:** How did Israel go from honored guests to slaves?
**Main Thesis:** A new Pharaoh arose who didn't know Joseph—and Israel's favor turned to oppression. But God's promises don't depend on human memory.
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 1:8 — "Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt."
**Content Direction:**

- The passing of time: generations in Egypt
- The new Pharaoh: fear of Israel's growth
- Oppression intensifies: slavery, infanticide
- The setup: Israel cries out; God remembers His covenant

---

### Day 2: The Cry and the Remembrance

**Key Question:** Does God hear when His people suffer?
**Main Thesis:** Israel groaned in slavery, and God heard. He remembered His covenant—not that He'd forgotten, but that He was about to act.
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 2:24-25 — "God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob."
**Content Direction:**

- Hebrew: "zakar" (remember)—not recall but act upon
- God's hearing: the cry reached Him
- Covenant faithfulness: Abraham's promise still valid
- The assurance: God hears your cry too

---

### Day 3: Moses: The Unlikely Deliverer

**Key Question:** Why did God choose Moses?
**Main Thesis:** Moses was a murderer in exile, tending sheep in obscurity. God chose the disqualified deliverer to demonstrate that the power is His, not ours.
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 3:10 — "So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt."
**Content Direction:**

- Moses's backstory: privilege, failure, exile
- Forty years in the wilderness: being shaped
- The burning bush: ordinary place, extraordinary encounter
- Moses's objections: "Who am I?"—exactly the point

---

### Day 4: I AM WHO I AM

**Key Question:** What does God's name reveal about Him?
**Main Thesis:** When Moses asked God's name, God revealed "I AM"—the self-existent, eternal, covenant-keeping God who was, is, and will be.
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 3:14 — "God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM.'"
**Content Direction:**

- Hebrew: "YHWH" (Yahweh)—the personal name of God
- Meaning: self-existence, eternality, faithfulness
- "I will be what I will be"—dynamic, present, active
- Jesus's claim: "Before Abraham was, I AM"

---

### Day 5: Confronting Pharaoh

**Key Question:** Why didn't Pharaoh let Israel go?
**Main Thesis:** Pharaoh's hard heart was both his own choice and God's sovereign purpose—the contest between Yahweh and Egypt's gods was about to begin.
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 5:2 — "Pharaoh said, 'Who is the Lord, that I should obey him?'"
**Content Direction:**

- Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh
- Pharaoh's question: "Who is Yahweh?"—he'll find out
- The hardening: Pharaoh's choice and God's purpose
- The stakes: not just freedom but cosmic authority

---

### Day 6: The Plagues: Judgment and Revelation

**Key Question:** What were the plagues about?
**Main Thesis:** The plagues were judgments on Egypt's gods—systematic demonstrations that Yahweh alone is God, and Egypt's powers are nothing.
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 12:12 — "I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord."
**Content Direction:**

- Each plague targeted an Egyptian deity
- Nile to blood: Hapi, the Nile god
- Darkness: Ra, the sun god
- The escalation: from discomfort to devastation
- The purpose: "That you may know that I am the Lord"

---

### Day 7: The Passover: Blood on the Door

**Key Question:** What did the Passover accomplish?
**Main Thesis:** The Passover was the pivot point—a lamb died so the firstborn could live. The blood on the doorpost was the sign of faith and the means of salvation.
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 12:13 — "When I see the blood, I will pass over you."
**Content Direction:**

- The final plague: death of the firstborn
- The provision: a lamb for each household
- The blood: applied to the doorpost
- The meaning: substitution, redemption, deliverance
- Jesus our Passover: sacrificed for us

---

### Day 8: Red Sea: Salvation and Destruction

**Key Question:** What does the Red Sea crossing teach about God?
**Main Thesis:** At the Red Sea, Israel saw God's salvation—the same waters that parted for them closed on their enemies. God fights for His people.
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 14:14 — "The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still."
**Content Direction:**

- The impossible situation: sea ahead, army behind
- Moses's charge: stand still and see salvation
- The parting: wind, water, dry ground
- The destruction: Pharaoh's army swallowed
- Pattern: God saves through impossible circumstances

---

### Day 9: The Song of Moses: Worship After Deliverance

**Key Question:** How did Israel respond to their salvation?
**Main Thesis:** After crossing the sea, Israel sang—the first recorded worship song in Scripture. Salvation leads to singing; deliverance produces praise.
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 15:1-2 — "I will sing to the Lord, for he is highly exalted."
**Content Direction:**

- The song: rehearsing what God did
- Worship as response to salvation
- Miriam and the women: dancing and tambourines
- The pattern: God acts, we respond with praise

---

### Day 10: Wilderness Testing: Manna and Water

**Key Question:** Why did God lead Israel through the wilderness?
**Main Thesis:** The wilderness was school—where Israel learned to depend on God daily for bread, water, and direction. The testing was for their formation, not their destruction.
**Scripture Focus:** Deuteronomy 8:3 — "He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna...to teach you that man does not live on bread alone."
**Content Direction:**

- Immediate crisis: no water, no food
- God's provision: manna daily, water from rock
- The lesson: daily dependence, not stockpiling
- Jesus: "I am the bread of life"

---

### Day 11: Sinai: Meeting God

**Key Question:** What happened at Mount Sinai?
**Main Thesis:** At Sinai, God descended in fire and smoke to meet His people and make covenant with them. This was the wedding between Yahweh and Israel.
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 19:5-6 — "If you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession."
**Content Direction:**

- The setting: thunder, lightning, thick cloud, trumpet
- God's offer: "You will be my treasured possession, a kingdom of priests"
- The marriage metaphor: Sinai as wedding ceremony
- Israel's response: "Everything the Lord has said we will do"

---

### Day 12: The Ten Commandments: Life with God

**Key Question:** What are the Ten Commandments about?
**Main Thesis:** The Ten Commandments are not arbitrary rules but the charter for covenant life—how a redeemed people live with their Redeemer and with each other.
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 20:2-3 — "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt. You shall have no other gods before me."
**Content Direction:**

- Preamble: "I am Yahweh who saved you"—grace precedes law
- Vertical: commands 1-4 (relationship with God)
- Horizontal: commands 5-10 (relationship with neighbor)
- Not earning salvation but living as the saved

---

### Day 13: The Golden Calf: Failure at the Foot of the Mountain

**Key Question:** How could Israel make an idol while Moses was receiving the Law?
**Main Thesis:** The golden calf reveals the human heart—even in the shadow of Sinai, fresh from salvation, we turn to other gods. The problem is us.
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 32:4 — "He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf."
**Content Direction:**

- Moses delayed; the people demanded gods
- Aaron's failure: passive leadership
- The idol: "These are your gods, O Israel"
- Moses's intercession: standing in the gap

---

### Day 14: The Tabernacle: God Dwelling Among Them

**Key Question:** What was the tabernacle, and why did it matter?
**Main Thesis:** The tabernacle was God's dwelling place among His people—portable Eden, where heaven and earth met and sinful humans could approach a holy God.
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 25:8 — "Have them make a sanctuary for me, and I will dwell among them."
**Content Direction:**

- God's desire: to dwell with His people
- The design: given by God in detail
- Temple imagery: Garden of Eden recreated
- The presence: glory cloud filling the tabernacle

---

### Day 15: On the Edge of Promise

**Key Question:** How does the wilderness period end?
**Main Thesis:** After forty years, a new generation stands at the Jordan—poised to enter what their parents forfeited. The promise delayed is not the promise cancelled.
**Scripture Focus:** Deuteronomy 6:4-5 — "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart."
**Content Direction:**

- The wilderness generation: died in unbelief
- The new generation: Moses's final sermons (Deuteronomy)
- The Shema: the central confession
- Anticipation: the Promised Land awaits

---

## Track 4: Kingdom Rise and Fall

**Days:** 15
**Target:** All believers
**Tagline:** They wanted a king. They got one. Then everything fell apart.

---

### Day 1: Crossing the Jordan

**Key Question:** What did entering the Promised Land mean?
**Main Thesis:** Crossing the Jordan was the fulfillment of 500 years of promise—from Abraham's call to Joshua's crossing. God keeps His word, even when it takes generations.
**Scripture Focus:** Joshua 3:17 — "The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord stopped in the middle of the Jordan and stood on dry ground."
**Content Direction:**

- The parallel: Red Sea and Jordan River
- The ark leading: God goes first
- The stones of remembrance: so future generations know
- Promise fulfilled: Abraham's descendants in Abraham's land

---

### Day 2: Conquest and Failure

**Key Question:** Why is the book of Joshua so violent?
**Main Thesis:** The conquest raises hard questions—but it must be understood as unique divine judgment, not a pattern for human behavior. And even then, Israel failed to complete it.
**Scripture Focus:** Joshua 11:23 — "So Joshua took the entire land, just as the Lord had directed Moses."
**Content Direction:**

- The command: destroy the inhabitants (herem)
- The context: 400 years of Canaanite wickedness (Genesis 15:16)
- The failure: Israel didn't fully obey
- The consequences: remaining nations became snares

---

### Day 3: The Cycle of Judges

**Key Question:** What went wrong after Joshua died?
**Main Thesis:** After Joshua, Israel fell into a repeated cycle: sin, suffering, crying out, rescue, rest—then back to sin. Without godly leadership, everyone did what was right in their own eyes.
**Scripture Focus:** Judges 2:16-19 — "Then the Lord raised up judges, who saved them...But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt."
**Content Direction:**

- The pattern: apostasy → oppression → cry → judge → deliverance → apostasy
- The judges: Deborah, Gideon, Samson—flawed rescuers
- The refrain: "Everyone did what was right in their own eyes"
- The need: a better king

---

### Day 4: Samuel: The Last Judge

**Key Question:** Who was Samuel, and what did he see?
**Main Thesis:** Samuel was prophet, priest, and judge—the last of his kind. He witnessed Israel's transition from theocracy to monarchy, and he warned them what they were choosing.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 Samuel 3:19 — "The Lord was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of Samuel's words fall to the ground."
**Content Direction:**

- Samuel's calling: the voice in the night
- His ministry: judge over Israel, faithful prophet
- The request for a king: "Like the other nations"
- God's response: they're not rejecting you; they're rejecting Me

---

### Day 5: Saul: The People's King

**Key Question:** Why did Saul fail as king?
**Main Thesis:** Saul looked like a king—tall, handsome, chosen—but his heart wasn't fully devoted to God. He represents what happens when we choose by appearance.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 Samuel 15:22-23 — "To obey is better than sacrifice...Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, he has rejected you as king."
**Content Direction:**

- Saul's selection: head and shoulders above the rest
- Early success: military victories
- The fatal flaw: partial obedience, self-justification
- The rejection: the kingdom torn from him

---

### Day 6: David: A Heart After God

**Key Question:** What made David different from Saul?
**Main Thesis:** God looks at the heart, not the appearance—and David, the youngest son, the shepherd boy, had a heart that pursued God even in failure.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 Samuel 16:7 — "The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."
**Content Direction:**

- David's anointing: the overlooked youngest son
- God's criterion: the heart
- David's character: worshipper, warrior, poet
- The irony: the shepherd boy becomes king; the tall king is rejected

---

### Day 7: The Davidic Covenant
