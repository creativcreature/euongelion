### Day 1: What Are Spiritual Disciplines?

**Key Question:** What are spiritual disciplines, and why do they matter?

**Scripture Focus:** 1 Timothy 4:7-8 — "Train yourself to be godly. For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things."
**Content Direction:**

- Greek: "gymnaze" (train, exercise)—the root of "gymnasium"

- The goal: becoming like Christ (Romans 8:29)

---

### Day 2: Grace and Effort

**Key Question:** If salvation is by grace, why do we need disciplines?
**Main Thesis:** Grace is opposed to earning, not to effort—we work out what God works in.
**Scripture Focus:** Philippians 2:12-13 — "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you."
**Content Direction:**

- Dallas Willard: "Grace is not opposed to effort; it is opposed to earning"

### Day 3: The Way of Jesus, Not Rules

**Key Question:** How do spiritual disciplines differ from religious rule-keeping?
**Main Thesis:** Jesus practiced spiritual disciplines as a way of life with the Father—we follow His example, not a checklist.
**Scripture Focus:** Mark 1:35 — "Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed."
**Content Direction:**

- Jesus prayed, fasted, withdrew, feasted, served

- Freedom within form: structure that liberates

---

### Day 4: Disciplines of Abstinence: Making Space

**Key Question:** Why do some disciplines involve giving things up?
**Main Thesis:** Disciplines of abstinence (fasting, silence, solitude, simplicity) create space by removing obstacles to God's presence.
**Scripture Focus:** Matthew 6:17-18 — "When you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others."
**Content Direction:**

- Overview: fasting, silence, solitude, simplicity, chastity, sacrifice

---

### Day 7: Silence: Stilling the Inner Noise

**Days:** 10
**Target:** Those wanting to hear God's voice and practice discernment

---

### Day 1: The God Who Speaks

**Key Question:** Does God still speak today, and if so, how?
**Main Thesis:** The Bible reveals a God who speaks—to Abraham, Moses, prophets, and through Jesus—and He has not gone silent.
**Scripture Focus:** Hebrews 1:1-2 — "In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets...but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son."
**Content Direction:**

- God's speech throughout Scripture
- Primary: God speaks in Scripture
- Secondary: Spirit, circumstances, others, creation
- The question isn't "Does God speak?" but "Are we listening?"

---

### Day 2: The Noise Problem

**Key Question:** Why is it so hard to hear God in modern life?
**Main Thesis:** We live in the noisiest environment in human history—external noise and internal chatter make hearing God nearly impossible without intentional practice.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 Kings 19:11-12 — "After the earthquake came a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper."
**Content Direction:**

- External noise: phones, media, constant input
- Internal noise: anxiety, planning, replaying, rehearsing
- God often speaks in "a still, small voice"—we have to quiet down to hear

---

### Day 3: Silence as Practice

**Key Question:** How does silence help us hear God?
**Main Thesis:** Silence creates the space for God's voice—not because God only speaks quietly, but because we need to calm our internal chaos to perceive Him.
**Scripture Focus:** Psalm 46:10 — "Be still, and know that I am God."
**Content Direction:**

- Hebrew: "raphah" (let go, cease striving)
- Practice: 5 minutes of silence, no agenda
- What to expect: restlessness, then (eventually) awareness of presence

---

### Day 4: Listening to Scripture

**Key Question:** How do I listen to God through the Bible?
**Main Thesis:** The primary way God speaks is through Scripture—but we need to read in a posture of listening, not just studying.
**Scripture Focus:** Luke 24:32 — "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us...and opened the Scriptures to us?"
**Content Direction:**

- Lectio Divina: an ancient practice of listening to Scripture
- Four movements: read, reflect, respond, rest
- Ask: "Lord, what are you saying to me?"

---

### Day 5: Listening to the Spirit

**Key Question:** How does the Holy Spirit communicate with us?
**Main Thesis:** The Spirit speaks through impressions, convictions, and illumination—not usually in audible voice, but in ways that align with Scripture and produce fruit.
**Scripture Focus:** John 16:13 — "When he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth."
**Content Direction:**

- How the Spirit speaks: conviction, peace, prompting, illumination
- Testing the spirits: Does it align with Scripture? Produce fruit? Lead to Jesus?
- Growing in sensitivity: this is a skill that develops

---

### Day 6: Listening Through Circumstances

**Key Question:** Can God speak through open and closed doors?
**Main Thesis:** God arranges circumstances sovereignly—open doors may be invitations, closed doors may be redirections—but circumstances alone don't interpret themselves.
**Scripture Focus:** Acts 16:6-10 — The Spirit prevented Paul from going to Asia; then the Macedonian call came.
**Content Direction:**

- Open doors: not always God's will (temptations are open doors too)
- Closed doors: not always "no" (sometimes "not yet")
- Circumstances need Scripture and community to interpret

---

### Day 7: Listening Through Others

**Key Question:** How can other people help us hear God?
**Main Thesis:** God often speaks through the body of Christ—wise counsel, prophetic words, and honest friends can be God's voice to us.
**Scripture Focus:** Proverbs 11:14 — "For lack of guidance a nation falls, but victory is won through many advisers."
**Content Direction:**

- The gift of wise counsel
- Prophecy: words of encouragement, comfort, building up (1 Cor 14:3)
- Community as confirmation: when multiple people say the same thing

---

### Day 8: Discernment: Testing What You Hear

**Key Question:** How do I know if something is from God, from me, or from somewhere else?
**Main Thesis:** Discernment is the skill of testing what we hear—Scripture, fruit, community, and peace are the primary tests.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 John 4:1 — "Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God."
**Content Direction:**

- Test 1: Does it align with Scripture?
- Test 2: Does it produce fruit of the Spirit?
- Test 3: Does it build up the body or just serve self?
- Test 4: Does it bring peace or anxiety?

---

### Day 9: When God Seems Silent

**Key Question:** What do I do when I don't hear anything?
**Main Thesis:** Divine silence is not abandonment—sometimes God's silence is an invitation to trust, to return to what He's already said, or to simply wait.
**Scripture Focus:** Psalm 13:1 — "How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever?"
**Content Direction:**

- Biblical examples of God's silence: David, Job, Jesus on the cross
- Possible meanings: God has already spoken (obey that first); trust is being developed; timing isn't right
- Practice: in silence, hold on to what you know

---

### Day 10: Cultivating a Listening Life

**Key Question:** How do I make listening to God a way of life?
**Main Thesis:** Hearing God isn't a one-time event but a cultivated posture—through daily practices, we learn to live with ears open.

**Content Direction:**

- Daily practice: morning time to listen
- Throughout the day: "Lord, what are you saying?"
- Journal: write down what you sense; review over time
- Invitation: Speak, Lord, your servant is listening

## Track 6: Digital Sabbath

**Days:** 5
**Target:** Those overwhelmed by technology, seeking boundaries

---

### Day 1: The Attention War

**Key Question:** What is technology doing to our souls?
**Main Thesis:** We are in an attention economy—billion-dollar companies are competing for our eyes, our time, and our thoughts, and the soul is collateral damage.
**Scripture Focus:** Romans 12:2 — "Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind."
**Content Direction:**

- The design of addiction: infinite scroll, notifications, variable reward
- What we're losing: attention span, depth, presence, rest
- This is not anti-technology; it's pro-intentionality

---

### Day 2: What We're Trading

**Key Question:** What is excessive screen time costing us spiritually?
**Main Thesis:** Every hour on screens is an hour not spent in prayer, relationships, nature, or silence—we're trading irreplaceable goods for cheap substitutes.
**Scripture Focus:** Ephesians 5:15-16 — "Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity."
**Content Direction:**

- Time is finite: every "yes" is a "no" to something else
- Spiritual costs: distraction from prayer, shallow relationships, constant comparison
- Physical costs: sleep disruption, eye strain, posture, dopamine depletion

---

### Day 3: The Practice of Digital Sabbath

**Key Question:** What would it look like to take a break from screens?
**Main Thesis:** A digital Sabbath is the intentional practice of disconnecting from technology—not to be legalistic but to be free.
**Scripture Focus:** Matthew 6:21 — "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
**Content Direction:**

- Define: 24 hours without screens (or significant reduction)
- What to do instead: walks, books, conversations, games, cooking, worship
- Start small: phone in a drawer during meals; grow from there

---

### Day 4: Practical Steps for Digital Sabbath

**Key Question:** How do I actually implement this?
**Main Thesis:** Success requires planning—you need boundaries, alternatives, and accountability to break digital habits.
**Scripture Focus:** 1 Corinthians 6:12 — "I will not be mastered by anything."
**Content Direction:**

- Before: tell people, set up auto-replies, charge phone in another room
- During: have alternatives ready (books, puzzles, outdoor plans)
- After: notice how you feel; journal the experience
- Tools: app timers, grayscale mode, physical alarm clocks

---

### Day 5: Freedom, Not Legalism

**Key Question:** Is digital Sabbath just another rule to feel guilty about breaking?
**Main Thesis:** The goal isn't perfection but freedom—digital Sabbath is a gift, not a burden; it's about reclaiming your attention for what matters most.
**Scripture Focus:** Galatians 5:1 — "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free."
**Content Direction:**

- Grace when you fail; just start again
- The goal: mastery over devices, not devices mastering you
- Invitation: try it once this week; see what happens
- Vision: a life where you choose your attention, not algorithms
