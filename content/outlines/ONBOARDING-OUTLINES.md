## Track 1: Welcome to EUONGELION

**Days:** 5
**Target:** All new users
**Tagline:** The war is over. The King has won. You just need to hear the news.

---

### Day 1: What Is Euangelion?

**Key Question:** What does "euangelion" actually mean, and why does it matter?
**Main Thesis:** Euangelion is the Greek word for "good news"—but in the ancient world, it was the word used when a king won a decisive victory. The war is over. That changes everything.
**Scripture Focus:** Mark 1:1 — "The beginning of the good news [euangelion] about Jesus the Messiah."
**Content Direction:**

- Greek word study: euangelion in the Roman world (imperial proclamations of victory)
- This isn't advice for self-improvement; it's news of something that already happened
- The difference between religion (what you must do) and gospel (what has been done)
- Welcome: you're joining people who believe this news changes everything

---

### Day 2: Why This Exists

**Key Question:** What makes EUONGELION different from other devotional apps?
**Main Thesis:** Most devotional content treats Scripture like a fortune cookie—random verses for random days. EUONGELION treats Scripture like a unified story that deserves deep engagement.
**Scripture Focus:** 2 Timothy 3:16-17 — "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness."
**Content Direction:**

- What's wrong with shallow devotional content: proof-texting, decontextualization
- Our approach: Hebrew and Greek word studies, historical context, compelling narrative
- The vision: content that respects your intelligence while nourishing your soul
- You're not here to consume; you're here to be transformed

---

### Day 3: The Three Depths

**Key Question:** How should I engage with the content each day?
**Main Thesis:** Every devotional offers three reading depths—Quick (2-3 min), Medium (5-7 min), and Deep (10-15 min)—so you can engage meaningfully whether you have five minutes or fifty.
**Scripture Focus:** Psalm 1:2-3 — "Whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night."
**Content Direction:**

- Quick: Essential insight, key Scripture, brief application
- Medium: Full narrative, word study, reflection questions
- Deep: Extended context, cross-references, extended meditation
- Permission: Different seasons require different depths; all are valuable

---

### Day 4: Grace for the Journey

**Key Question:** What happens when I miss a day or fall behind?
**Main Thesis:** EUONGELION is not about streaks, guilt, or performance metrics. You don't "fail" by missing a day. This is about relationship with God, not religious achievement.
**Scripture Focus:** Romans 8:1 — "There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
**Content Direction:**

- The tyranny of streaks: why gamification can harm spiritual formation
- Grace means: start where you are, not where you "should" be
- No catching up required—jump back in without guilt
- The goal: not perfect attendance but growing intimacy with God

---

### Day 5: Finding Your Path

**Key Question:** Where should I start my journey?
**Main Thesis:** EUONGELION offers multiple pathways based on where you are—whether you're a new believer, a lifelong Christian, or someone still exploring. Your path is here.
**Scripture Focus:** Proverbs 3:5-6 — "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight."
**Content Direction:**

- Overview of content categories: Doctrinal, Disciplines, Apologetics, Emotional Support, Story of God
- How to choose: based on current season, questions, or interest
- Recommendations for new believers, skeptics, mature Christians
- Invitation: begin with one series; let that lead to the next

---

## Track 2: How to Approach This Material

**Days:** 5
**Target:** All new users
**Tagline:** Come as you are. Leave different.

---

### Day 1: No Prerequisites Required

**Key Question:** Am I ready for this? Do I need to know something before I start?
**Main Thesis:** You don't need a theology degree, prior Bible knowledge, or perfect faith to engage this material. You are invited as you are—doubts, questions, and all.
**Scripture Focus:** Matthew 11:28 — "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."
**Content Direction:**

- Permission: You don't need to be "good enough" to start
- Jesus invited fishermen, tax collectors, and doubters
- What you bring: curiosity, willingness, whatever faith you have (even mustard-seed sized)
- The only requirement: show up honestly

---

### Day 2: The Lost Art of Slow Reading

**Key Question:** Why should I read slowly in a world that rewards skimming?
**Main Thesis:** We live in a skimming culture—but Scripture rewards slow, careful, repeated reading. The depth is in the details, and the details take time.
**Scripture Focus:** Psalm 119:97 — "Oh, how I love your law! I meditate on it all day long."
**Content Direction:**

- Hebrew: "hagah" (meditate)—to mutter, chew, ponder over time
- What we lose by skimming: nuance, connection, depth
- Practice: read the day's Scripture three times before reading the devotional
- Counter-cultural: slow is not lazy; slow is attentive

---

### Day 3: Engaging with Doubt

**Key Question:** Is it okay to doubt while reading this?
**Main Thesis:** Doubt is not the opposite of faith—certainty is. Honest doubt, brought to God, can become the doorway to deeper trust.
**Scripture Focus:** Mark 9:24 — "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"
**Content Direction:**

- The father's honest prayer: belief and unbelief coexisting
- Biblical doubters: Thomas, John the Baptist, David in the Psalms
- How to engage doubt: bring it to God, don't suppress it
- EUONGELION welcomes questions; we don't fear them

---

### Day 4: Making It Personal

**Key Question:** How do I move from reading to transformation?
**Main Thesis:** Information alone doesn't change us—reflection, prayer, and application do. Learn to take what you read and let it sink into your soul.
**Scripture Focus:** James 1:22 — "Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says."
**Content Direction:**

- The head-to-heart journey: knowledge → meditation → application
- Tools: journaling your responses, praying through the Scripture
- Questions to ask: "What is this saying to me? How does this change how I live today?"
- Practice: end each session with one concrete response

---

### Day 5: The Compound Effect

**Key Question:** Does daily spiritual engagement really make a difference?
**Main Thesis:** Spiritual formation works like compound interest—small daily investments, over time, produce exponential growth. Consistency matters more than intensity.
**Scripture Focus:** Galatians 6:9 — "Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up."
**Content Direction:**

- The compound effect: small + consistent = transformational
- Stories of transformation: how daily bread sustained Israel for forty years
- Manna principle: daily provision, daily dependence
- Invitation: commit to showing up regularly, not perfectly
- Benediction: May your daily bread nourish you for the journey ahead
