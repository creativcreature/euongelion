In Acts 3-5, the movement of Jesus' followers becomes public. A miraculous healing at the Temple gate draws astonished crowds. Bold preaching by the apostles challenges the authorities. Opposition quickly rises. The young community's unity and integrity are tested. And through all of it, the name of Jesus proves unstoppable.",

        "text": "The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and others of the high priest's family. They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: \"By what power or what name did you do this?\"\n\nThen Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: \"Rulers and elders of the people! If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed, then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. Jesus is 'the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.'\n\nSalvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.\"\n\nWhen they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus. But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say. So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together. \"What are we going to do with these men?\" they asked. \"Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign, and we cannot deny it. But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name.\"\n\nThen they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John replied, \"Which is right in God's eyes: to listen to you, or to him? You be the judges! As for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.\"\n\nAfter further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened. For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.\n\nOn their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them. When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. \"Sovereign Lord,\" they said, \"you made the heavens and the earth and the sea, and everything in them. You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David: 'Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed one.'\n\nIndeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed. They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen. Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.\"\n\nAfter they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.",

He says, 'Look at what the risen Jesus is doing right now.'\n\nThe miracle produces: personal transformation, public astonishment, theological confrontation, and evangelistic opportunity.\n\nPeter's ensuing sermon reframes the event. This healing is not random; it is a continuation of Jesus' ministry - proof that He is alive and still acting through His people."

Their pointed question, 'By what power or what name did you do this?', is not genuine curiosity. It is an accusation.\n\nPeter's answer puts Jesus at the center of everything: 'It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead.' This is the moment Christianity stops being a quiet, private movement and becomes a public proclamation.\n\nWhen the council orders them to stay silent, Peter and John refuse: 'We cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.' The church's response to these threats is not fear, but prayer, and God answers. The building shakes as the Spirit fills them once again, giving them more boldness instead of less."

Ananias and Sapphira want the reputation of generosity without the sacrifice of it. The Holy Spirit exposes the lie quickly and dramatically.\n\nWhy such severity? Because hypocrisy, if left unchecked, rots the foundation of the church. The Spirit zealously guards the community so that its witness genuinely reflects its message."

When the apostles are hauled before the Sanhedrin again, they do not defend themselves - they defend the gospel: 'We must obey God rather than human beings.'\n\nAfter the council has them flogged, the apostles depart rejoicing. It is a joy that makes no sense unless one believes deeply in the worthiness of Jesus. Acts 5 concludes with this triumphant image: 'Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.' In other words, pressure does not silence these disciples; it multiplies them."

A miracle at the Temple gate would be like a miraculous event on the steps of a modern capitol building.

Rome tolerated the Jewish authorities only as long as there were no riots, no messianic uprisings, and no hint of rebellion. The sudden growth of thousands of new Jesus-followers created serious tension. The Sanhedrin feared losing control and, even more, losing Roman approval. Thus, the opposition in Acts is political, theological, social, and institutional. Beneath it all, we can sense the currents of spiritual warfare."

            "description": "The same disciple who denied Jesus three times before the crucifixion now stands before the Sanhedrin and declares, 'Salvation is found in no one else.' Filled with the Holy Spirit, Peter demonstrates that boldness is not a personality trait but the fruit of divine empowerment.",
