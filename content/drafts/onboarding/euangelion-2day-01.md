# EUANGELION

## Day 1: The Announcement

---

### The Word

_Eu-an-GEL-ee-on_ (εὐαγγέλιον).

It's Greek. And it doesn't mean what you think.

In the ancient world, _euangelion_ wasn't a religious term. It was a military one. When a messenger ran from the battlefield to announce that the war was won—lungs burning, legs failing—that announcement was _euangelion_. Good news. The kind that changes everything.¹

The early Christians borrowed this word deliberately. They weren't offering advice, therapy, or a philosophy for better living. They were making an announcement:

**The battle is over. The King has won. Everything is about to change.**

### A Story

In 1972, a Japanese soldier named Hiroo Onoda emerged from the Philippine jungle. He had been hiding for _twenty-nine years_.

Sent to Lubang Island in 1944 with orders to never surrender, Onoda refused to believe the war had ended. Leaflets announcing Japan's surrender? Propaganda. Family members with loudspeakers? A trick.

It wasn't until his former commanding officer personally issued the order to stand down that Onoda finally surrendered.

He had been free for twenty-nine years. He just didn't know it.²

**Some of you have been living in a war that's already over.**

Fighting. Surviving. Convinced you have to earn God's favor, that you're not good enough, that the battle is still raging.

But the _euangelion_ has already been declared. "It is finished."³

You just have to come out of the jungle.

### Why This Exists

This platform was born from a single verse:

> "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."⁴

For years, those words felt impossible. But then something shifted. Not because life got easier. Because those words became real.

**EUONGELION exists because that kind of encounter shouldn't be rare.**

### The Invitation

Whatever you're carrying—bring it.

The announcement has been made. The war is over.

Come home.

---

**Breath Prayer**

**Inhale:** "The battle is over."
**Exhale:** "Lead me home."

### Reflection

1. What brought you here? What were you searching for?
2. Is there a "war" in your life that might already be finished?
