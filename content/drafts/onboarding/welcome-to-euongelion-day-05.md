## Day 5: Your Journey Begins

---

Five days ago, you showed up.

Maybe you weren't sure what you'd find. Maybe you're still not sure. That's okay.

You showed up anyway. And today, your journey begins in earnest.

### A Brief Review

Here's what we've covered:

**Day 1:** What this place is—daily bread for hungry souls. A path home for people who sense there's more.

**Day 2:** How we're different—going deep instead of wide, taking original languages seriously, telling stories, connecting everything to Jesus, inviting response instead of just consumption.

**Day 3:** How to read Scripture—the four levels of interpretation, reading for encounter rather than information, slowing down.

**Day 4:** What to expect—the structure of devotionals, the interactive elements, the freedom to be imperfect.

And now, Day 5. The threshold.

### What Happens Next

Starting Monday, you'll receive your first devotional series.

Based on what you shared when you signed up, we've matched you with content designed for where you are—whether you're exploring faith from scratch, returning after time away, or deepening roots that are already planted.

Each series has a beginning and an end. When one finishes, another begins. The rhythm continues.

Some series will hit home immediately. Others might feel like a stretch. Both are valuable. Growth often happens at the edges of our comfort zones.

### A Word Before You Go

There's a Hebrew word for blessing: _berakah_ (בְּרָכָה).

Pronounced: beh-rah-KHAH.

It comes from the root _barak_, which means to kneel—like a camel kneeling to receive a load, or a person kneeling in reverence.¹

A blessing isn't just nice words. It's the transfer of something real. In the ancient world, a father's blessing carried weight—it conferred identity, favor, future. That's why Jacob fought so hard for it, even deceiving his own father.²

We want to send you into this journey with a blessing.

Not because we have power to confer anything. But because we're participating in something God has been doing since He spoke to Abraham: calling a people, blessing them, and sending them out to be a blessing to others.³

So here it is.

### A Benediction

May you find what you're looking for—and discover it's better than you imagined.

May the words on these pages come alive in you. May the ancient texts speak to your present circumstances. May the God who inspired them meet you in them.

May your doubts be honored, not dismissed. May your questions be welcomed, not silenced. May you find that faith is less about certainty and more about trust.

May you encounter _hesed_—the relentless, stubborn, covenant love that doesn't quit. May _shalom_ become not just a word but an experience—wholeness in the broken places, peace that doesn't depend on circumstances.

May you know that you are loved. Not because of what you do. Not because of who you might become. But because of who you already are: a creature made in the image of God, invited into relationship with the One who made you.

And when you stumble—because you will—may you find grace waiting. Not condemnation. Not disappointment. Grace upon grace.⁴

This is your beginning.

Go.

### One More Thing

You're not doing this alone.

Somewhere out there, others are reading these same words. Others are starting their own journeys today. Others are wrestling, hoping, doubting, believing.

You're part of a community you'll never fully see. People across time zones and continents, united by hunger for something real.

We don't know where this leads. We don't know what God will do in you. But we believe He's doing _something_—because He always is.

Welcome to EUONGELION.

Welcome to the good news.

Welcome home.

### Breath Prayer

**Inhale:** "Here I am, Lord."
**Exhale:** "Send me."⁵

### Reflection

1. As you stand at the beginning of this journey, what is one thing you're hoping for? What's one thing you're afraid of?

2. The blessing above includes the phrase "faith is less about certainty and more about trust." What does that distinction mean to you? Does it comfort or unsettle you?

### Notes

1. The Hebrew root _barak_ (ברך) is associated with kneeling. See: Harris, R. Laird, Gleason L. Archer Jr., and Bruce K. Waltke, eds. _Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament_. Chicago: Moody Press, 1980. Entry 285.

2. Genesis 27 recounts Jacob's deception to receive Isaac's blessing, demonstrating the weight blessings carried in the ancient Near East.

3. Genesis 12:1-3, God's call to Abraham: "I will bless you... and you will be a blessing... and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you."

4. John 1:16: "From his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace." (ESV)

5. Isaiah 6:8: "And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, 'Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?' Then I said, 'Here I am! Send me.'" (ESV)
