# EUANGELION

## Day 3: What You'll Find Here

---

### A Different Kind of Depth

You've probably tried other things. Bible apps with guilt-inducing streaks. Devotionals that felt like greeting cards with verses. Reading plans abandoned by mid-January.

Here's what we're doing differently.

---

### We Go Deep, Not Wide

Most devotionals try to cover as much ground as possible. Breadth over depth. Quantity over quality.

We're doing the opposite.

Each devotional focuses on a single passage. Sometimes a single word. We'd rather you understand one thing deeply than skim over ten things shallowly.

The Scriptures aren't a textbook to get through. They're a well to draw from. And wells don't reward speed—they reward stillness.

---

### We Take the Original Languages Seriously

The word _euangelion_ shares its root with _angelos_ (ἄγγελος)—the word we translate as "angel."

An _angelos_ isn't a chubby baby with wings. It's a messenger. Someone sent with news.¹

So _euangelion_ literally means "good message"—and the one who brings it is an _euangelistes_, a good-news-bringer.

Throughout these devotionals, we'll show you Hebrew and Greek words like this. Not to be academic. But because the original words carry meanings that English translations sometimes flatten.

---

### We Tell Stories. We Point to Jesus.

The Bible is a story, and humans learn through stories. Each devotional weaves in narratives—from history, from everyday life—that make ancient truths tangible.

And everything points to Jesus. This isn't moralistic self-help. Every passage, every theme finds its fulfillment in the carpenter from Nazareth who claimed to be God and then walked out of a tomb.

---

### We Invite Response

Each devotional ends with:

- **Breath prayers**—short phrases synced with breathing
- **Reflection questions**—not quizzes, but invitations
- **Space to journal**—processing out loud with God

You don't have to do all of it. Some days you'll engage deeply. Some days you'll skim. Both are okay.

The goal isn't perfection. It's presence. Show up.

---

### A Benediction

May the _euangelion_ sink deep.

May you discover that the war you've been fighting is already won. May peace that surpasses understanding guard your heart and mind.

May you encounter not just words about God, but God Himself.

Welcome to EUONGELION.

Welcome to the good news.

Welcome home.

**Breath Prayer**

**Inhale:** "Here I am, Lord."
**Exhale:** "Send me."²

---

### Reflection

1. Which aspect—depth, original languages, stories, Jesus-centeredness, response—are you most drawn to?
2. What would "showing up" look like for you in this season?

---

### Notes

1. The Greek _angelos_ (ἄγγελος) means "messenger."
2. Isaiah 6:8 (ESV).
