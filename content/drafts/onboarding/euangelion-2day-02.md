# EUANGELION

## Day 2: What You'll Find Here

---

### A Different Kind of Depth

You've probably tried other things. Bible apps with guilt-inducing streaks. Devotionals that felt like greeting cards with verses. Reading plans abandoned by January.

Here's what we're doing differently:

**We go deep, not wide.** One passage. One truth. One word—unpacked until it changes you.

**We take the original languages seriously.** Hebrew and Greek aren't just for scholars. The original words carry meanings that English translations sometimes flatten. We'll show you what's underneath.

**We tell stories.** The Bible is a story, and humans learn through stories. Each devotional weaves in narratives that make ancient truths tangible.

**Everything points to Jesus.** This isn't moralistic self-help. Every passage, every theme finds its fulfillment in the carpenter from Nazareth who walked out of a tomb.

**We invite response.** Not just consumption. Breath prayers, reflection questions, space to journal. This is an invitation to encounter, not content to consume.

### The Greek Word for "Messenger"

The word _euangelion_ shares its root with _angelos_ (ἄγγελος)—the word we translate as "angel."

An _angelos_ isn't a chubby baby with wings. It's a messenger. Someone sent with news.

So _euangelion_ literally means "good message"—and the one who brings it is an _euangelistes_, a good-news-bringer.¹

That's what these devotionals aim to be. Messengers. Not the message itself—that belongs to God. But carriers of the announcement.

The battle is over. The King has won.

### What to Expect

Each day you'll receive a devotional:

- An opening that draws you in
- Scripture, explored at depth
- A Hebrew or Greek word study
- A story that bridges then and now
- Interactive elements—breath prayers, reflection questions

**You don't have to finish everything.** Some days you'll engage deeply. Some days you'll skim. Both are okay. The goal isn't perfection. It's presence.

Show up. That's all.

### A Benediction

May the _euangelion_ sink deep.

May you discover that the war you've been fighting is already won. May peace that surpasses understanding guard your heart and mind.

May you encounter not just words about God, but God Himself.

Welcome to EUONGELION.

Welcome to the good news.

**Breath Prayer**

**Inhale:** "Here I am, Lord."
**Exhale:** "Send me."²

### Reflection

1. Which aspect of the approach—depth, original languages, stories, Jesus-centeredness, response—are you most drawn to?
2. What would "showing up" look like for you in this season?

---

### Notes

1. The Greek _angelos_ (ἄγγελος) means "messenger" and appears over 175 times in the New Testament.
2. Isaiah 6:8 (ESV).
