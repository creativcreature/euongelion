# Welcome to EUONGELION

## Day 1: What Is This Place?

---

### The Name You're Trying to Pronounce

You're probably wondering how to say it.

_Eu-on-GEL-ee-on._

It's Greek. And it means something you've heard a thousand times but maybe never really heard: _good news_.

Not "good advice." Not "good vibes." Not "good luck."

_Good news._

The kind of news that changes everything. The kind that makes a messenger run across a battlefield, lungs burning, legs failing, because the outcome of the war has shifted and everyone needs to know. That's what _euongelion_ meant in the ancient world—the announcement that the battle is over, the king has won, and everything is about to change.¹

This is where you've landed. Not an app. Not a program. Not another thing to add to your already overflowing life.

A path home.

---

### Why You're Here

We don't know exactly what brought you here. Maybe someone shared a link. Maybe you were searching for something at 2 AM when the house was quiet and your thoughts weren't. Maybe you used to believe and don't anymore. Maybe you still believe but it feels like going through the motions. Maybe you've never believed but something keeps pulling at you.

It doesn't matter which door you came through. You're here now.

And here's what we believe about you, even though we've never met:

**You were made for relationship with God.**

Not religion. Not ritual. Not rule-following.

_Relationship._

The kind where you're known and loved. The kind where your questions are welcome. The kind where you don't have to pretend to have it together.

The Scriptures tell a story—one story, from beginning to end—of a God who relentlessly pursues the people He made. Not because they earned it. Not because they deserved it. But because He is who He is.

> "The Lord your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his love; he will exult over you with loud singing."²

That's not the distant, angry God you might have been taught to fear. That's a Father who sings over His children.

And He's been waiting for you to come home.

### What This Place Is

EUONGELION is daily bread for hungry souls.

That phrase—_daily bread_—comes from the prayer Jesus taught His followers:

> "Give us this day our daily bread."³

In the ancient world, bread wasn't a side dish. It was survival. It was the thing you couldn't live without. And Jesus taught us to ask for it _daily_—not weekly, not monthly, not in bulk. Every single day, we come with open hands.

That's what this is. A daily practice of coming to God with open hands.

Each day, you'll receive a devotional. Not a quick verse with a chipper thought attached. Something deeper. Something that respects your intelligence and your time. Something that takes the Scriptures seriously—including the parts that are hard, the parts that don't fit on a coffee mug, the parts that have been making people uncomfortable for millennia.

We believe you can handle it.

We believe the Word of God doesn't need to be watered down to be accessible. It needs to be _illuminated_—the obscure made clear, the ancient made present, the foreign made familiar.

That's what we're trying to do here.

### The Hebrew Word for "Word"

Speaking of illumination—let's do something you'll experience often in these devotionals. Let's look at a word.

The Hebrew word for "word" is _davar_ (דָּבָר).

Pronounced: dah-VAHR.

But here's what's fascinating: _davar_ doesn't just mean "word" the way we think of it—sounds that convey meaning. In Hebrew, _davar_ also means "thing" or "matter" or "event."⁴

When God speaks, things happen.

"And God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light."⁵

The word and the reality are the same. God's speech isn't just information—it's creation. It's power. It's reality coming into being.

This matters for how you approach Scripture. The Bible isn't just words _about_ God. It's God's _davar_—His speech that creates, shapes, transforms.

When you read these devotionals, you're not just learning information. You're encountering the living Word of a God who speaks things into existence.

Including new life in you.

### A Story: The Long Way Home

In 1972, a Japanese soldier named Hiroo Onoda finally emerged from the Philippine jungle.

He had been hiding for _twenty-nine years_.

Onoda was sent to Lubang Island in 1944 with orders to conduct guerrilla warfare and never surrender. When the war ended in 1945, he didn't believe it. Leaflets were dropped announcing Japan's surrender—he thought they were propaganda. Family members came to the jungle with loudspeakers, begging him to come out—he thought it was a trick. For nearly three decades, he lived in the mountains, convinced the war was still going on, waiting for orders that would never come.⁶

It wasn't until his former commanding officer traveled to the Philippines and personally issued the order to stand down that Onoda finally surrendered his sword and rifle.

He had been free for twenty-nine years. He just didn't know it.

Here's why that story matters:

Some of you have been living in a war that's already over.

You've been hiding, fighting, surviving—convinced that you have to earn God's favor, that you're not good enough, that the battle is still raging. But the announcement has already been made. The _euongelion_ has already been declared.

"It is finished."⁷

Jesus said those words from the cross. It is finished. The debt is paid. The war is won. You don't have to keep fighting.

You just have to come out of the jungle.

That's what this place is for. Not to add another burden to your life. Not to give you more rules to follow. But to help you hear the news that's already true: **You are loved. You are forgiven. You are invited home.**

The commanding officer has come. The order has been given.

Will you receive it?

### What Makes This Different

You've probably tried other devotionals. Bible apps with reading plans you abandoned by February. Daily emails that pile up unread. Books with helpful tips that felt hollow after a week.

We get it. We've been there too.

Here's what we're trying to do differently:

**1. We go deep, not wide.**

Each devotional focuses on a single passage, a single theme, a single truth. We'd rather you understand one thing deeply than skim over ten things shallowly. Quality over quantity. Depth over breadth.

**2. We take the original languages seriously.**

Hebrew and Greek aren't just for scholars. The original words of Scripture carry meanings, echoes, and connections that often get lost in translation. We'll show you those words—how to pronounce them, what they mean, why they matter. Not to be academic, but to be illuminating.

**3. We tell stories.**

The Bible is a story, and stories are how humans learn best. Each devotional weaves in narratives—sometimes from history, sometimes from contemporary life—that make ancient truths tangible. You'll meet real people who faced real struggles and found that God was real in the middle of it.

**4. We connect everything to Jesus.**

This isn't moralistic self-help. This isn't "try harder, be better." Every passage, every theme, every truth finds its fulfillment in Jesus Christ. He is the center. We keep pointing there.

**5. We invite response, not just consumption.**

At the end of each devotional, you'll find reflection questions and interactive elements—breath prayers, journaling prompts, physical practices. This isn't content to consume. It's an invitation to encounter.

### The Vision

Here's what we're believing for:

**People seeking God daily. Communities transforming because of it.**

Not people checking boxes. Not people performing spirituality. Not people who know all the right answers but have hearts that are far away.

_People seeking God._ Actually hungry for Him. Actually pursuing Him. Actually finding that He was pursuing them all along.

And when that happens to individuals, it doesn't stay individual. It spills over. Families heal. Friendships deepen. Churches come alive. Neighborhoods change.

We're sowers of seeds. We plant. We water. But God gives the growth.⁸

Some seeds fall on rocky ground. Some get choked by thorns. Some bear fruit—thirty, sixty, a hundredfold.⁹

We don't control the harvest. We just keep sowing.

And you're here, which means a seed has landed in your soil.

What happens next is between you and God.

### An Invitation

Before we close this first day, let's do something together.

Find a quiet spot. If you can't find quiet, find stillness—even if the noise continues around you.

Take a breath. A real one. Feel your lungs expand. Feel them release.

Now read these words slowly, out loud if you can:

> "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
> He makes me lie down in green pastures.
> He leads me beside still waters.
> He restores my soul."¹⁰

That's what's being offered here. Not a productivity hack for your spiritual life. Not another thing to optimize.

_Soul restoration._

The Hebrew word for "restore" is _shuv_ (שׁוּב)—to return, to come back, to go home.¹¹

That's the invitation. Come home.

You don't have to have it all figured out. You don't have to clean up first. You don't have to perform or pretend.

Just come.

### What's Next

Tomorrow, we'll talk about how this place is different—the method we use to read Scripture, the posture we're inviting you into, the kind of community we're building.

For now, just sit with this:

_You are welcome here._

Not the version of you that has it together. Not the version that reads their Bible every day and never has doubts. Not the future you that's finally got this faith thing figured out.

_This_ you. The one reading these words right now. The one with questions and fears and hopes and wounds.

You are welcome here.

The good news has been announced. The war is over. The Father is singing.

Come home.

**[INTERACTIVE ELEMENT]**

_Breath Prayer for Today_

A breath prayer is a short phrase you repeat with your breathing—inhale on the first part, exhale on the second.

Today's breath prayer:

**Inhale:** "Lord, I am here."
**Exhale:** "Lead me home."

Try it now. Three times. Slowly.

Inhale: _Lord, I am here._
Exhale: _Lead me home._

Inhale: _Lord, I am here._
Exhale: _Lead me home._

Inhale: _Lord, I am here._
Exhale: _Lead me home._

Carry this with you today. In the car. In line at the store. When your mind wanders. When anxiety rises.

_Lord, I am here. Lead me home._

### Reflection Questions

1. What door did you come through to get here? What were you searching for?

2. Hiroo Onoda lived in a war that was already over. Is there a "war" in your own life—a battle you've been fighting—that might already be finished?

3. The Hebrew word _shuv_ means "to return" or "come home." What does "home" mean to you spiritually? Have you ever felt at home with God?
