## Day 1: Why This Exists

---

You're probably wondering how to say it.

_Eu-on-GEL-ee-on._

It's Greek. It means _good news_—the kind that changes everything.

### The Verse That Started It All

This platform exists because of six words:

> "Do not be anxious about anything."¹

That's Philippians 4:6. And for a long time, it felt like a cruel joke.

_Don't be anxious?_ Tell that to the 3 AM thoughts. Tell that to the racing heart in the grocery store checkout line. Tell that to the weight that sits on your chest when everything looks fine on the outside.

But the verse doesn't stop there:

> "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."²

_Peace that surpasses understanding._ Not peace that makes sense. Not peace because everything worked out. Peace that guards you even when nothing makes sense.

That verse became a lifeline. And this platform exists to share it.

### Why EUONGELION?

There's a longer story—one we'll tell eventually. But the short version is this:

**God met someone in their anxiety. And that encounter changed everything.**

Not in a "everything got easy" way. In a "I found something real" way. Something that actually held weight. Something that wasn't shallow positivity or empty religious performance.

And the thought came: _What if there was a place for people who are hungry for that kind of depth?_

Not another app with chipper notifications. Not another reading plan you'll abandon by February. Not another thing to add to your already overflowing life.

**A path home for people who sense there's more.**

That's what this is. That's why it exists.

### What You've Found

EUONGELION is daily bread for hungry souls.

Each day, you'll receive a devotional. Not a quick verse with a chipper thought attached. Something deeper. Something that takes Scripture seriously—including the hard parts, the parts that don't fit on a coffee mug.

We believe you can handle it.

We believe the Word of God doesn't need to be watered down to be accessible. It needs to be _illuminated_—the obscure made clear, the ancient made present.

That's what we're trying to do here.

### An Invitation

Before we close this first day, try something.

Find a quiet spot. Take a breath—a real one.

Now read these words slowly:

> "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God."

Whatever you're carrying right now—the thing that keeps you up, the decision you can't make, the weight you can't name—you're invited to bring it.

Not to fix. Not to solve. Just to bring.

That's the invitation. Come as you are.

---

### Breath Prayer

**Inhale:** "I bring everything to You."
**Exhale:** "Guard my heart and mind."

---

### Reflection

1. What brought you here today? What were you searching for?
2. What does "peace that surpasses understanding" sound like to you—fantasy, or something you've glimpsed?

---

### Notes

1. Philippians 4:6a (ESV).
2. Philippians 4:6-7 (ESV).
