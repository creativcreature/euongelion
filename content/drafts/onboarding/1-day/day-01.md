# EUANGELION

## Welcome to the Good News

### The Word That Changes Everything

_Eu-an-GEL-ee-on_ (εὐαγγέλιον).

It's Greek. And it doesn't mean what you think.

In the ancient world, _euangelion_ wasn't a religious term. It was a military one. When a messenger ran from the battlefield to announce that the war was won—lungs burning, legs failing, voice cracking with exhaustion—that announcement was _euangelion_. Good news. The kind that changes everything.^1

The early Christians borrowed this word deliberately. They weren't offering advice, therapy, or a philosophy for better living. They were making an announcement:

**The battle is over. The King has won. Everything is about to change.**

That's what you've stumbled into. Not an app. Not a program. Not another thing to optimize.

An announcement.

### A Story of Liberation

In 1972, a Japanese soldier named Hiroo Onoda emerged from the Philippine jungle.

He had been hiding for _twenty-nine years_.

Sent to Lubang Island in 1944 with orders to never surrender, Onoda refused to believe the war had ended. Leaflets announcing Japan's surrender? Propaganda. Family members with loudspeakers, begging him to come out? A trick. For nearly three decades, he lived in the mountains, convinced the battle was still raging.^2

It wasn't until his former commanding officer personally issued the order to stand down that Onoda finally surrendered his sword and rifle.

He had been free for twenty-nine years. He just didn't know it.

**Some of you have been living in a war that's already over.**

Fighting. Surviving. Convinced that you have to earn God's favor, that you're not good enough, that the battle is still raging.

But the _euangelion_ has already been declared. "It is finished."^3

You just have to come out of the jungle.

### Why This Platform Exists

This platform was born from a single verse:

> "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."^4

For years, those words felt impossible. _Don't be anxious?_ Tell that to the 3 AM thoughts. Tell that to the weight on your chest when everything looks fine on the outside.

But then something shifted. Not because life got easier. Because those words became real—peace that doesn't make sense, peace that guards you when nothing else can.

**EUONGELION exists because that kind of encounter shouldn't be rare.**

Not just for the spiritually elite. For the lost. The wandering. The ones who sense there's more.

For you.

### What You'll Find Here

Here's how we're different:

**Deep, Not Wide.** One passage unpacked thoroughly. We'd rather you understand one thing deeply than skim ten things shallowly.

**Original Languages.** Hebrew and Greek word studies that illuminate what translations flatten. Not to be academic—because the original words carry meanings worth knowing.

**Stories.** The Bible is a story, and humans learn through stories. Each devotional weaves in narratives that make ancient truths tangible.

**Jesus-Centered.** Everything points to the carpenter from Nazareth who claimed to be God and then walked out of a tomb.

**Response Invited.** Breath prayers, reflection questions, and journaling prompts. Not just content to consume—an invitation to encounter.

### What to Expect

Each day you'll receive a devotional:

- An opening that draws you in
- Scripture, explored at depth
- A Hebrew or Greek word study
- A story that bridges then and now
- Interactive elements: breath prayers, reflection questions

**You don't have to finish everything.** Some days you'll engage deeply. Some days you'll skim. Both are okay. The goal isn't perfection. It's presence.

**Day-gating is intentional.** One day at a time. This isn't content to binge. It's a rhythm. Trust the pace.

**This is a marathon, not a sprint.** You won't transform overnight. But show up most days for a season? You'll be different.

### The Invitation

Whatever you're carrying—the anxiety, the doubt, the questions you can't answer—bring it.

> "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything... let your requests be made known to God."

The _euangelion_ has been announced. The war is over.

Come home.

**Breath Prayer**

**Inhale:** "The battle is over."
**Exhale:** "Lead me home."

### Reflection Questions

1. What brought you here? What were you searching for?
2. Is there a "war" in your life—a battle you've been fighting—that might already be finished?
