## Day 2: The Long Way Home

### A Story of Liberation

In 1972, a Japanese soldier named Hiroo Onoda emerged from the Philippine jungle.

He had been hiding for _twenty-nine years_.

Sent to Lubang Island in 1944 with orders to never surrender, Onoda refused to believe the war had ended. Leaflets announcing Japan's surrender? Propaganda. Family members with loudspeakers, begging him to come out? A trick. For nearly three decades, he lived in the mountains, convinced the battle was still raging.^1

It wasn't until his former commanding officer personally issued the order to stand down that Onoda finally surrendered his sword and rifle.

He had been free for twenty-nine years. He just didn't know it.

### The Connection

Some of you have been living in a war that's already over.

Fighting. Surviving. Convinced that you have to earn God's favor, that you're not good enough, that the battle is still raging.

But the announcement has already been made. The _euangelion_ has already been declared.

"It is finished."^2

Jesus said those words from the cross. The debt is paid. The war is won.

You don't have to keep fighting. You just have to come out of the jungle.

### The Hebrew Word for "Return"

The Hebrew word _shuv_ (שׁוּב) means to return, to come back, to go home.^3

> "He restores my soul."^4

That's the word—_shuv_. He brings your soul back home.

The prophets used this word constantly. "Return to the Lord your God."^5 It's not just a physical journey. It's a turning—of heart, of direction, of life.

That's what the _euangelion_ makes possible. You can come home. The door is open. The Father is waiting.

### What This Means for You

You weren't made to live in the jungle.

You were made for relationship with God. Not religion. Not performance. Not rule-following. _Relationship_.

And the Scriptures tell one story from beginning to end: a God who relentlessly pursues the people He made. Not because they earned it. Because He is who He is.

If you've drifted, He's looking for you.
If you've doubted, He can handle your questions.
If you've never believed, the invitation stands.

The commanding officer has come. The order has been given.

Will you receive it?

**Breath Prayer**

**Inhale:** "Lord, I am here."
**Exhale:** "Lead me home."

### Reflection Questions

1. Is there a "war" in your life—a battle you've been fighting—that might already be finished?
2. What does "home" mean to you spiritually? Have you ever felt at home with God?
