# Welcome to EUONGELION

## Day 1: Why Are You Here?

---

That's not a rhetorical question.

Something brought you here. A link someone shared. A search at 2 AM. A name you couldn't pronounce but clicked anyway.

_Eu-on-GEL-ee-on._ It's Greek. It means _good news_.

But before we get to the news, let's sit with the question:

**Why are you here?**

---

### Maybe You're Searching

Maybe faith used to make sense and now it doesn't. Maybe you grew up in church and walked away. Maybe you never believed but something keeps pulling at you—a question you can't dismiss, a longing you can't name.

Maybe you're exhausted. By the performance. By the noise. By trying to hold it all together while something inside is quietly falling apart.

If any of that resonates, you're in the right place.

### Why This Exists

This platform was born from a single verse:

> "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."

That's Philippians 4:6-7.

For years, those words felt impossible. _Don't be anxious?_ Tell that to the racing thoughts. Tell that to the weight on your chest when everything looks fine on the outside.

But then something shifted. Not because life got easier. Because those words became real. Peace that doesn't make sense. Peace that guards you when nothing else can.

**EUONGELION exists because that kind of encounter shouldn't be rare.**

Not just for the people who grew up knowing the right answers. Not just for the spiritually elite. For the lost. The wandering. The ones who sense there's more but don't know where to find it.

For you.

### What We Believe About You

You were made for relationship with God.

Not religion. Not performance. Not rule-following.

_Relationship._

The Scriptures tell one story from beginning to end: a God who relentlessly pursues the people He made. Not because they earned it. Because He is who He is.

If you've drifted, He's looking for you.
If you've doubted, He can handle your questions.
If you've never believed, the invitation stands.

We're not here to convince you. We're here to sow seeds. What grows is between you and God.

### What This Place Is

EUONGELION is daily bread for people who want more than surface-level faith.

Each day, you'll receive a devotional. Not a quick verse with a chipper thought attached. Something with substance. Something that takes Scripture seriously—the beautiful parts and the hard parts.

We go deep into the original Hebrew and Greek. We tell stories that make ancient truths tangible. We connect everything to Jesus. And we invite response, not just consumption.

You can handle depth. We believe that about you.

---

### An Invitation

Before we close this first day, try something.

Whatever you're carrying—the anxiety, the doubt, the question you can't answer—bring it.

> "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything... let your requests be made known to God."

Not to fix. Not to solve. Just to bring.

That's the invitation. Come as you are.

---

### Breath Prayer

**Inhale:** "I bring everything to You."
**Exhale:** "Guard my heart and mind."

---

### Reflection

1. Why are you here—really? What were you searching for when you found this?
2. What would "peace that surpasses understanding" look like in your life right now?

---

### Notes

1. Philippians 4:6-7 (ESV).
