# EUANGELION

## The Good News

### The Word

_Eu-an-GEL-ee-on_ (εὐαγγέλιον).

It's Greek. And it doesn't mean what you think.

In the ancient world, _euangelion_ wasn't a religious term. It was a military one. When a messenger ran from the battlefield to announce that the war was won—lungs burning, legs failing—that announcement was _euangelion_. Good news. The kind that changes everything.¹

The early Christians borrowed this word deliberately. They weren't offering advice, therapy, or a philosophy for better living. They were making an announcement:

**The battle is over. The King has won. Everything is about to change.**

That's what you've stumbled into. Not an app. Not a program. Not another thing to optimize.

An announcement.

### Why This Exists

This platform was born from a single verse:

> "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."²

For years, those words felt impossible. _Don't be anxious?_ Tell that to the 3 AM thoughts.

But then something shifted. Not because life got easier. Because those words became real—peace that doesn't make sense, peace that guards you when nothing else can.

**EUONGELION exists because that kind of encounter shouldn't be rare.**

Not just for the spiritually elite. For the lost. The wandering. The ones who sense there's more.

For you.

### What You'll Find Here

Daily devotionals that go deep instead of wide. Hebrew and Greek word studies that illuminate what translations flatten. Stories that make ancient truths tangible. Everything pointing to Jesus.

And an invitation—not to consume content, but to encounter the God who's been pursuing you all along.

### The Invitation

Whatever you're carrying—anxiety, doubt, questions you can't answer—bring it.

> "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything... let your requests be made known to God."

The _euangelion_ has been announced. The war is over.

Come home.

**Breath Prayer**

**Inhale:** "The battle is over."
**Exhale:** "Lead me home."

### Reflection

1. What brought you here? What were you searching for?
2. What would it mean to believe the "war" in your life is already won?
