## Day 3: How to Read Scripture

---

There's a way to read the Bible that leaves you unchanged.

You've probably done it. Eyes moving across the page. Mind somewhere else. Check the box, close the book, move on with your day.

And there's another way. A way that reads _you_ while you read it.

Today, we want to introduce you to that way.

### The Four Levels

Ancient Jewish interpreters developed a framework for reading Scripture called _PaRDeS_ (פַּרְדֵּס). The word means "orchard" or "garden"—the same root that gives us "paradise."

It's an acronym for four levels of interpretation:

**Peshat** (פְּשָׁט) — The Plain Meaning
What does the text actually say? What's the straightforward, surface-level reading? This is where we start. Grammar, context, historical setting. Before we go deeper, we need to understand what's on the page.

**Remez** (רֶמֶז) — The Hint
What is the text pointing to beyond itself? Are there allusions to other passages? Patterns that echo elsewhere in Scripture? The Bible is a unified story, and texts talk to each other. _Remez_ is learning to hear the conversation.

**Derash** (דְּרַשׁ) — The Search
What does this text mean for how we live? This is application—but not the shallow kind. It's wrestling with the text until it blesses you. Asking hard questions. Letting it ask hard questions back.

**Sod** (סוֹד) — The Secret
What is the deeper, spiritual meaning? This is the mystical dimension—the level where we encounter not just information about God, but God Himself. Not every text yields this. But when it happens, you know.

You don't need to memorize these categories. Just know that the Bible is layered. It can be read at different depths. And the deeper you go, the more you find.

### Read for Encounter, Not Just Information

Here's the shift that changes everything:

**Stop reading the Bible to learn things. Start reading it to meet Someone.**

Information is important. Context matters. Knowing that Corinth was a Roman port city full of competing religions genuinely helps you understand Paul's letters. We're not anti-intellectual.

But information isn't the goal. Encounter is.

The Scriptures are not primarily a textbook. They're a meeting place. The ancient rabbis called studying Torah a form of worship—because in engaging with God's word, you engage with God Himself.

So when you open the Bible—or when you open these devotionals—come with expectation. Not expectation that you'll feel something dramatic (feelings are unreliable). Expectation that the living God is present and ready to meet you.

He usually does.

### A Word to Practice With

Let's try this together. Here's a word: _shalom_ (שָׁלוֹם).

You've probably heard it. It's the Hebrew word usually translated "peace."

But like _hesed_ yesterday, _shalom_ is bigger than its English translation.

_Shalom_ doesn't just mean the absence of conflict. It means wholeness, completeness, flourishing. It's when everything is in its right place—when relationships are healthy, when creation functions as designed, when nothing is missing or broken.

The prophets envisioned a future _shalom_—a world where the wolf lies down with the lamb, where swords become plowshares, where God dwells with His people and wipes every tear from their eyes.¹

And here's what's striking: this word shares a root with _shalem_, meaning "complete" or "whole." When you wish someone _shalom_, you're wishing them not just peace but wholeness. Not just the end of hostility but the beginning of flourishing.

Now take that understanding back to every place you've read "peace" in Scripture.

"The Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you _shalom_."²

"_Shalom_ I leave with you; my _shalom_ I give to you."³

Feel how the word expands?

That's what happens when you slow down.

### How to Slow Down

Some practical suggestions:

**Read less, more slowly.** You don't have to finish the chapter. A few verses, read three times, will often give you more than a full chapter skimmed once.

**Read out loud.** Scripture was written to be heard. Speaking the words engages your body and changes how they land. (The Hebrew word for "meditate," _hagah_, literally means to mutter or speak quietly to yourself.)⁴

**Ask questions.** What surprises you? What confuses you? What comforts you? What confronts you? Let curiosity be your guide.

**Sit with discomfort.** When a text bothers you, don't rush past it. That friction might be exactly where growth happens.

**Pray before and after.** Simple words: "Open my eyes, Lord." And when you finish: "What do you want me to carry from this?"

This isn't a formula. It's a posture. Come to the text expecting to meet God, and be willing to be changed by the meeting.

### A Brief Word on Translation

We'll generally use the ESV (English Standard Version) in these devotionals, with occasional references to other translations when they illuminate something.

No English translation is perfect. Every translation is already an interpretation. That's why we show you Hebrew and Greek words—so you can see what's underneath the English.

Don't worry about learning the languages. Just know they're there, and we'll show you the good stuff.

### Breath Prayer

**Inhale:** "Open my eyes."
**Exhale:** "Show me wonders in Your Word."⁵

### Reflection

1. Which of the four levels (Peshat, Remez, Derash, Sod) do you naturally gravitate toward? Which feels most unfamiliar?

2. Think of a passage you've read many times. What would it look like to approach it at a slower pace—reading it out loud, sitting with it, letting it read you?

---

### Notes

1. Isaiah 11:6-9 (wolf and lamb), Isaiah 2:4 / Micah 4:3 (swords to plowshares), Revelation 21:3-4 (God dwelling with His people).

2. Numbers 6:26 (ESV), the Aaronic blessing.

3. John 14:27 (ESV), Jesus' words to His disciples.

4. The Hebrew word _hagah_ (הָגָה) appears in Joshua 1:8 ("meditate on it day and night") and Psalm 1:2 ("on his law he meditates"). It carries the sense of quiet vocalization—reading aloud to oneself.

5. Adapted from Psalm 119:18: "Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law." (ESV)
