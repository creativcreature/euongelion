# EUANGELION

## Day 2: What You'll Find Here

---

### A Different Kind of Depth

You've probably tried other things. Bible apps with guilt-inducing streaks. Devotionals that felt like greeting cards with verses. Reading plans abandoned by mid-January.

Here's what we're doing differently.

---

### The Greek Word for "Messenger"

The word _euangelion_ shares its root with _angelos_ (ἄγγελος)—the word we translate as "angel."

An _angelos_ isn't a chubby baby with wings. It's a messenger. Someone sent with news.^1

So _euangelion_ literally means "good message"—and the one who brings it is an _euangelistes_, a good-news-bringer.

That's what these devotionals aim to be. Messengers. Not the message itself—that belongs to God. But carriers of the announcement.

The battle is over. The King has won.

### Five Principles That Guide Everything

**Deep, Not Wide.** Most devotionals try to cover as much ground as possible. Breadth over depth. Quantity over quality. We're doing the opposite. Each devotional focuses on a single passage. Sometimes a single word. We'd rather you understand one thing deeply than skim over ten things shallowly.

The Scriptures aren't a textbook to get through. They're a well to draw from. And wells don't reward speed—they reward stillness.

**Original Languages.** Hebrew and Greek aren't just for scholars. Throughout these devotionals, we'll show you words like _euangelion_ and _shuv_ (the Hebrew word for "return"). Not to be academic. But because the original words carry meanings that English translations sometimes flatten.

**Stories.** The Bible is a story, and humans learn through stories. Each devotional weaves in narratives—from history, from everyday life—that make ancient truths tangible.

**Jesus-Centered.** This isn't moralistic self-help. Every passage, every theme finds its fulfillment in the carpenter from Nazareth who claimed to be God and then walked out of a tomb.

**Response Invited.** Not just consumption. Breath prayers, reflection questions, and space to journal. This is an invitation to encounter, not content to consume.

### What to Expect Each Day

Each devotional includes:

- An opening hook that draws you in
- Scripture, explored at depth
- A Hebrew or Greek word study
- A story that bridges then and now
- Interactive elements: breath prayers, reflection questions

**You don't have to finish everything.** Some days you'll engage deeply. Some days you'll skim. Both are okay. The goal isn't perfection. It's presence.

**Day-gating is intentional.** One day at a time. This isn't content to binge. It's a rhythm. Trust the pace.

**This is a marathon, not a sprint.** You won't transform overnight. But show up most days for a season? You'll be different.

### A Benediction

May the _euangelion_ sink deep.

May you discover that the war you've been fighting is already won. May peace that surpasses understanding guard your heart and mind.

May you encounter not just words about God, but God Himself.

Welcome to EUONGELION.

Welcome to the good news.

Welcome home.

**Breath Prayer**

**Inhale:** "Here I am, Lord."
**Exhale:** "Send me."^2

---

### Reflection Questions

1. Which aspect of the approach—depth, original languages, stories, Jesus-centeredness, response—are you most drawn to?
2. What would "showing up" look like for you in this season?

---

### Notes

1. The Greek _angelos_ (ἄγγελος) means "messenger" and appears over 175 times in the New Testament.
2. Isaiah 6:8 (ESV).
