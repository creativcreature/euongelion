## Section A: The Hook

### The Girl They Called by the Wrong Name

She was born in a Korean orphanage. No birth certificate. No family records. No one who could tell her where she came from or why she was there.

The orphanage gave her a name. It was not the name her birth mother had given her—if her birth mother had given her one at all. It was a name assigned by staff, written on a tag, attached to a crib.

At eighteen months old, she was adopted by an American family. They gave her another name—Jennifer. An American name for her American life. She grew up in Ohio, went to church, played soccer, applied to college. Jennifer.

But some nights, when the house was quiet, she would lie awake and wonder: _Who was I before I was Jennifer?_

---

When she was twenty-six, Jennifer traveled to South Korea. She hired a researcher to help her find her birth family. The odds were slim—records were incomplete, decades had passed, and thousands of children had moved through that orphanage.

But the researcher found something. A name. A real name—her first name, the one given by her birth mother in the three days they were together before she was surrendered.

_Eun-bi._ It meant "graceful sorrow."

Jennifer wept when she heard it. Not because it was beautiful—though it was. Because she finally knew what she had been called. Someone had looked at her, newborn and small, and named her. Someone had known her, even if only for three days. Someone had given her an identity before the world assigned her one.

She was not a number. She was not a tag on a crib. She was _Eun-bi_. And that mattered.

### The God Who Knows Your Name

There is something profound about being named. To be named is to be known, to be claimed, to be seen as a particular person rather than a generic member of a category.

Names have power. When someone forgets your name, it stings. When someone remembers it—especially someone important, someone you didn't expect to notice you—something shifts. You feel seen.

In Isaiah 43, God speaks to a people who felt like orphans. Israel had been conquered, scattered, and exiled. Their temple was destroyed, their land was occupied, their identity was in crisis. Were they still God's people? Had he forgotten them? Had the name "Israel" become meaningless—just a tag on an empty crib?

Into this darkness, God speaks:

_"Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine."_

Not "I have called a nation." Not "I have redeemed a people group." _I have called you by name._ Particular. Personal. Intimate.

The God of the universe knows your name. Not the one assigned by institutions or circumstances. The one that describes who you really are. The one he gave you before the foundation of the world.

### Where We Are in God's Story

We are in the Exile. The northern kingdom of Israel fell to Assyria in 722 BC. The southern kingdom of Judah fell to Babylon in 586 BC. The temple—the dwelling place of God—was reduced to rubble. The people were scattered across a foreign empire.

Isaiah prophesies before, during, and (in these later chapters) beyond the exile. Chapters 40-66 are often called the "Book of Comfort" because they speak hope to a people who have lost everything.¹

The context matters. These are not words spoken to people enjoying prosperity. They are words spoken to people in captivity, people who have every reason to believe that God has abandoned them.

And yet: "Fear not."

---

## Section B: The Text

### The Context of Judgment

Isaiah 43 does not stand alone. It follows Isaiah 42, which ends with a searing description of judgment:

> "Who gave up Jacob to the looter, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned, in whose ways they would not walk, and whose law they would not obey? So he poured on him the heat of his anger and the might of battle." (Isaiah 42:24-25)

The exile was not random bad luck. It was the consequence of centuries of covenant unfaithfulness. Israel had been warned repeatedly by the prophets. They had ignored the warnings. And now they were living in the rubble of their choices.

But then comes the pivot. The first two words of chapter 43 in Hebrew are _ve-attah_—"but now."²

"But now thus says the LORD..."

Everything changes. The tone shifts from judgment to tenderness, from consequence to compassion. The people have not earned this comfort. They have done nothing to deserve this reassurance. But God speaks anyway.

This is grace. Not the response to performance, but the interruption of it.

---

### Peshat: The Plain Meaning

Let's walk through the passage phrase by phrase.

**"But now thus says the LORD, he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel..."**

God introduces himself with two verbs: _bara_ (created) and _yatsar_ (formed). These are the verbs of Genesis—the verbs used to describe God making the world and shaping humanity.³

By using these words, God is saying: "I am the one who brought you into existence. I am your origin. Whatever has happened since—the sin, the exile, the destruction—does not change the fact that I made you."

Identity precedes failure. You are God's creation before you are God's disappointment.

**"Fear not, for I have redeemed you..."**

The Hebrew verb _ga'al_ (גָּאַל) is technical language from Israel's kinship system. The _go'el_—the kinsman-redeemer—was the family member responsible for rescuing a relative in distress.⁴

If a family member was sold into slavery, the _go'el_ would pay the price to set them free. If land was lost, the _go'el_ would buy it back. The _go'el_ was the one who restored what had been forfeited.

When God says "I have redeemed you," he is claiming the role of kinsman. He is saying: "You are family. You belong to me. And I will pay whatever price is necessary to bring you home."

**"...I have called you by name, you are mine."**

Two claims, each profound.

First: "I have called you by name." Not by category, not by function, not by utility—by name. God's relationship with his people is not corporate only; it is personal.

Second: "You are mine." The Hebrew is simply _li-attah_—"to me, you." The word order emphasizes possession. You belong to me. You are not a commodity. You are not disposable. You are claimed, owned, treasured.

**"When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you..."**

The language here echoes the Exodus. Israel passed through the waters of the Red Sea on dry ground. They passed through the Jordan River into the Promised Land. Now, in exile, facing metaphorical "waters" of destruction, God promises to be with them again.⁵

The promise is not that you will avoid the waters. It is that you will pass _through_ them. The presence of God does not guarantee the absence of suffering; it guarantees companionship in suffering.

**"...when you walk through fire, you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you."**

This may anticipate the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in Daniel 3, thrown into Nebuchadnezzar's furnace and emerging unharmed. Or it may simply use fire as a common metaphor for trial and testing.

Either way, the promise stands: the fire that would destroy you will not destroy you. You will walk through. You will emerge. The flames will not have the final word.

**"For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior."**

The passage closes with three divine titles: LORD (_Yahweh_), Holy One of Israel, Savior. The God who makes these promises is not a tribal deity or a limited spirit. He is the covenant God who revealed himself to Moses, the transcendent Holy One set apart from all creation, and the Savior who rescues his people.

This is the ground beneath the comfort. Fear not—because of _who_ is speaking.

## Section C: The Center — The Hebrew Deep-Dive

### גָּאַל (Ga'al) — "Redeemed"

The Hebrew word _ga'al_ (גָּאַל) is the heart of this passage. It means to redeem, to act as kinsman-redeemer, to ransom from bondage.⁶

The concept has its roots in ancient Israelite family law. When a relative fell into debt slavery, it was the _go'el's_ responsibility to purchase their freedom. When family land was lost through poverty, the _go'el_ had the right and duty to buy it back. The _go'el_ was the one who restored what sin, circumstance, or misfortune had taken away.

The book of Ruth provides the clearest picture. Ruth, a Moabite widow, has no resources and no future. Boaz, a relative of her deceased husband, steps into the role of _go'el_. He redeems the family land and marries Ruth, restoring everything that was lost.⁷

When God says "I have ga'al-ed you," he is claiming the role Boaz played. He is the kinsman who will pay the price, buy back what was forfeited, and restore the inheritance.

But here is what makes this stunning: the price has not yet been paid. Israel is still in exile when Isaiah speaks. The redemption is future. Yet God speaks of it as already accomplished—"I _have_ redeemed you." The certainty of God's intention is so absolute that he speaks of future deliverance in the past tense.

This is the prophetic perfect—the grammatical expression of divine certainty.⁸

### שֵׁם (Shem) — "Name"

The Hebrew word _shem_ (שֵׁם) means name, but in Hebrew thought, a name is far more than a label. A name is essence. A name reveals character. A name carries destiny.⁹

When God changes Abram's name to Abraham, or Jacob's name to Israel, he is not just updating their files. He is declaring who they are becoming. The name change is identity transformation.

In Isaiah 43, God does not change Israel's name; he _calls_ it. He speaks it. He knows it. The intimacy is in the calling itself.

Consider the contrast with Babylon. Israel is in a foreign land where they are nobodies—exiles, captives, the defeated remnant of a conquered nation. To Babylon, they are a labor pool, a tax base, an administrative category.

But to God, they are Jacob. They are Israel. They are named.

And so are you. You may feel like a number—employee ID, Social Security number, case file, diagnostic code. But to God, you have a name. Not the name assigned by systems but the name he knows, the name written in the Lamb's book of life.¹⁰

---

### עִמְּךָ (Immekha) — "With You"

The phrase "I will be with you" contains the Hebrew word _im_ (עִם), meaning "with" in the sense of accompaniment, presence, solidarity.¹¹

This is not distant oversight. It is not surveillance from afar. It is the presence of a companion walking beside you—through the waters, through the fire, through whatever darkness lies ahead.

The same word appears in some of the most significant moments of biblical history:

- "Do not fear, for I am _with_ you" (Genesis 26:24, to Isaac)
- "I am _with_ you and will keep you wherever you go" (Genesis 28:15, to Jacob)
- "I will be _with_ you" (Exodus 3:12, to Moses)
- "Be strong and courageous... for the LORD your God is _with_ you" (Joshua 1:9, to Joshua)

The repeated promise throughout Scripture is not that circumstances will be easy, but that God will be _im_—with, alongside, present.

And in the Incarnation, this promise finds its ultimate expression. _Immanuel_—God _with_ us. The Word becomes flesh and dwells _among_ us. The promise of Isaiah 43 takes on human form and walks through water and fire with us.

## Section B': The Christ Connection — The Remez

### The Ultimate Kinsman-Redeemer

The _go'el_ imagery of Isaiah 43 finds its fulfillment in Jesus Christ.

In Ruth's story, Boaz could redeem because he was kinsman—a blood relative with both the right and the resources to pay the price. But there was a catch: a closer relative existed who had the first right of redemption. That relative declined; he could not afford the cost.¹²

Jesus is the kinsman-redeemer who does not decline. He becomes our kinsman by taking on human flesh—"flesh and blood" like ours, as Hebrews puts it, so that "through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death."¹³

And he can afford the price. The redemption price is not silver or gold, but his own blood: "You were ransomed... not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot" (1 Peter 1:18-19).

When God said through Isaiah "I have redeemed you," he was speaking in prophetic certainty of a redemption that would be accomplished at Calvary. The price that seemed impossible—the ransom of a people sold into slavery to sin—was paid by the kinsman who became one of us to buy us back.

---

### Through the Waters, Through the Fire

The imagery of passing through water and fire finds echoes throughout Jesus' ministry and the life of his followers.

**The Baptism of Jesus.** When Jesus entered the waters of the Jordan, he was not being cleansed of sin—he had none. He was identifying with sinners, passing through waters of judgment on our behalf. His baptism anticipated his death, burial, and resurrection: going down into death, rising to new life.¹⁴

**The Cross as Fire.** The "fire" imagery connects to sacrifice. The burnt offerings of Leviticus were wholly consumed by fire—a picture of complete dedication to God and, simultaneously, of judgment falling on the substitute instead of the sinner.¹⁵

Jesus entered the fire for us. He was consumed so we would not be. He passed through the flames of divine judgment so that we, passing through our own trials, can know: the consuming fire has already been satisfied.

**The Furnace of Affliction.** In Daniel 3, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were thrown into a furnace heated seven times hotter than normal. But Nebuchadnezzar saw four figures walking in the fire—"and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods."¹⁶

The presence in the fire is the presence of Isaiah 43 made visible. You will walk through fire—but you will not walk alone. The Son of God is in the furnace with you.

---

### "You Are Mine"

The possessive language of Isaiah 43—"you are mine"—reverberates through the New Testament.

Jesus speaks of his sheep: "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand" (John 10:27-28).

Paul speaks of our belonging: "You are not your own, for you were bought with a price" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).

The language of ownership may sound troubling in a culture that prizes autonomy. But this is not the ownership of master and slave; it is the ownership of lover and beloved, of rescuer and rescued.

To be "his" is to be protected, treasured, claimed. It means that all the powers of hell cannot pry you loose. It means that your identity does not depend on your performance but on his purchase.

You are his. And he does not let go of what is his.

## Section A': The Return — Derash and Sod

### What This Means for Jennifer

Let's return to Jennifer—Eun-bi—sitting in a Seoul office, hearing her original name for the first time.

What she found in that name was not just information. It was identity. Someone had known her. Someone had given her a name that meant something. She was not an accident, not a number, not a burden to be processed. She was _graceful sorrow_—named by a mother who saw her, even briefly, as a particular and precious person.

This is a dim echo of what Isaiah 43 offers. God knows your name—not the one circumstances assigned, but the one that captures who you really are. And unlike the birth mother who could only hold Jennifer for three days, God never lets go.

"Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine."

---

Whatever waters you are passing through—the diagnosis that changed everything, the job loss that upended your security, the relationship that fell apart—the promise holds. Not that you will avoid the waters, but that they will not overwhelm you. Not that you will escape the fire, but that the flames will not consume you.

Because the God who speaks is not watching from a distance. He is _with_ you. He is _im_. He is the fourth figure in the furnace, walking with you through the heat.

And more than that: he has already done the impossible. He has _ga'al_-ed you. He has paid the price of a kinsman-redeemer. Whatever you have lost—innocence, identity, hope, years—he is buying it back. The redemption is certain, so certain that God speaks of it as already accomplished.

### The Deeper Mystery (Sod)

There is a level of Isaiah 43 that goes beyond application into the mysteries of divine love.

Why does God redeem Israel? They have not earned it. They are in exile precisely because they have broken covenant, ignored prophets, and worshiped idols. By any reasonable measure, they have forfeited the relationship.

Yet God speaks: "Fear not, for I have redeemed you."

The answer lies not in Israel's worthiness but in God's character. He redeems because he is a Redeemer. He claims because he is a Claimer. He speaks names because he is an intimate, personal God who cannot be satisfied with categories.

This is the deep magic beneath the surface of Scripture—a love that does not calculate, a grace that does not measure, a commitment that does not waver. God's faithfulness is grounded not in our performance but in his own nature.

He cannot stop being who he is. And who he is, is a kinsman who redeems.

### The Name on the White Stone

Revelation 2:17 contains a remarkable promise:

> "To the one who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, with a new name written on the stone that no one knows except the one who receives it."

A new name. A secret name. A name known only to you and to God.

Throughout your life, you have been named by many voices. Parents named you. Peers labeled you. Institutions categorized you. Failures defined you. But none of those names are final.

The final name is the one God will give you. The name that captures who you have become through all the waters and all the fires. The name that is true in a way no earthly name has ever been.

And here is the mystery: that name is already known to God. He has been speaking it over you since before you were born. The name on the white stone is not an invention of the future; it is a revelation of what has always been true in the mind of the One who called you.

_I have called you by name. You are mine._

## Breath Prayer

**Inhale:** "You have called my name..."
**Exhale:** "...I am yours."

_Repeat slowly for five breaths. Let the words become a homecoming._

## Reflection Questions

1. **What "name" has been spoken over you that you need to release?** The label from a critical parent, a past failure, a diagnosis, a defeat—what false name have you accepted as your identity? What would it mean to hear God call you by your true name instead?

2. **What waters are you passing through right now?** Be specific. Name the flood—the circumstances that feel overwhelming, the crisis that threatens to pull you under. Now consider: what would change if you believed that these waters would not overwhelm you, that the God who redeemed you is _with_ you in them?

3. **How does the language of "you are mine" land on you?** Does it feel like comfort or like constriction? Why? What might it mean to belong fully to a God who paid the ultimate price to claim you?

## Notes

1. Isaiah 40-66 is often called the "Book of Comfort" or "Deutero-Isaiah" by critical scholars who believe it was written later. Evangelical scholars generally maintain Isaianic authorship while acknowledging the distinct tone of these chapters. See Motyer, J. Alec. _The Prophecy of Isaiah_. Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 1993.

2. The Hebrew _ve-attah_ (וְעַתָּה) functions as a strong adversative, marking a sharp transition from what precedes. See Waltke, Bruce K., and M. O'Connor. _An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax_. Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1990. Section 39.3.4d.

3. _Bara_ (בָּרָא) is used for divine creation in Genesis 1:1, 21, 27. _Yatsar_ (יָצַר) is used for God "forming" man from the dust in Genesis 2:7. See Brown, Francis, S.R. Driver, and Charles A. Briggs. _The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon_. Peabody, MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1906. Entries H1254 and H3335.

4. Brown-Driver-Briggs, Entry H1350.

5. The Red Sea crossing (Exodus 14) and Jordan River crossing (Joshua 3) are foundational events in Israel's collective memory, frequently referenced in prophecy and poetry.

7. The full story of Boaz as _go'el_ is found in Ruth 3-4.

8. The "prophetic perfect" is a grammatical phenomenon in which future events are described in past tense to emphasize their certainty. See Waltke and O'Connor, _Biblical Hebrew Syntax_, Section 30.5.1e.

10. Revelation 3:5; 21:27; Philippians 4:3.

12. Ruth 4:1-6 describes the nearer kinsman who declined to redeem.

13. Hebrews 2:14.

14. For the connection between Jesus' baptism and his death, see Matthew 20:22-23, where Jesus speaks of his coming death as a "baptism."

15. The _olah_ (burnt offering) of Leviticus 1 was entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing complete dedication and, implicitly, complete judgment.
