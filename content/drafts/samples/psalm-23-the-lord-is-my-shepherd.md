## Section A: The Hook

### The Weight of Wanting

She sat in the parking lot of the grocery store for forty-five minutes, unable to go inside.

The list was simple: milk, bread, eggs. But the fluorescent lights, the choices, the small talk with cashiers—it all felt impossible. Not because anything catastrophic had happened. The day was ordinary. The weight was not.

This is the texture of modern life for millions of people. Not dramatic crisis, but a low-grade hum of _not enough_. Not enough time. Not enough energy. Not enough certainty that you're doing any of it right. The phone buzzes with another notification, another demand, another thing requiring your attention. The soul feels like a browser with forty-seven tabs open, none of them loading properly.

We are a people who want. We want rest but cannot stop. We want peace but cannot quiet the noise. We want to be known but have curated ourselves into unrecognizability. We are drowning in abundance and starving for something we cannot name.

Into this exhaustion, an ancient song speaks.

_The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want._

These are not the words of someone who has everything. They are the words of someone who has discovered something—or rather, _Someone_—that changes the equation entirely. David wrote this psalm as a man who knew both the wilderness and the palace, who had been hunted by a king and become one, who had failed spectacularly and been forgiven lavishly.

He knew what it was to want. And he knew what it was to stop.

### Where We Are in God's Story

We are in the Kingdom section of God's grand narrative. David, the shepherd-boy-turned-king, has been established on Israel's throne. The promise to Abraham is taking shape—a people, a land, a king. But David is not the final chapter. He is a signpost, a preview, a shadow of what is coming.

Every time David tends his flock, every time he leads Israel with wisdom and stumbles with sin, he is pointing forward to another Shepherd, another King—one who will not merely manage the sheep but lay down his life for them.¹

Psalm 23 is not just ancient poetry. It is prophecy set to music.

## Section B: The Text

### The Context David Knew

To understand these words, we must first understand sheep.

Sheep are not intelligent animals. They cannot find water on their own. They do not navigate terrain well. Left to themselves, they will wander into danger, eat toxic plants, and drown in rivers their own wool makes too heavy to escape.² They are utterly dependent on their shepherd—not as a nice addition to their lives, but as the difference between life and death.

David knew this. Before he was a king, before he killed Goliath, before Samuel's oil ran down his forehead, he was a shepherd in Bethlehem's fields. He had spent years guiding, protecting, and providing for creatures who could not do any of it for themselves.

When David wrote "The LORD is my shepherd," he was not reaching for a pleasant metaphor. He was making a confession: _I am a sheep. I am dependent. I am incapable of surviving on my own._

This is the Peshat—the plain meaning. The surface level. And it is already more radical than we usually allow.

### The Cultural Weight

In the ancient Near East, kings regularly called themselves shepherds of their people. Egyptian pharaohs, Assyrian monarchs, Babylonian rulers—all used shepherd imagery to describe their power.³ It was political language. A shepherd-king was one who provided for, protected, and guided his subjects.

But there is a crucial difference in David's psalm. He does not call himself the shepherd. He calls himself the sheep. The king of Israel, the most powerful man in the nation, writes a song about his own vulnerability and dependence.

And he does not say "a shepherd" or "my shepherd among many." He says "The LORD"—Yahweh, the covenant name of God revealed to Moses at the burning bush, the name so holy that Jews would not speak it aloud—"_is_ my shepherd."

Not might be. Not could be. _Is._

## Section C: The Center — The Hebrew Deep-Dive

### רֹעִי (Ro'i) — My Shepherd

The Hebrew word _ro'eh_ (רֹעֶה) means shepherd, but its root _ra'ah_ (רָעָה) carries a richer meaning: to pasture, to tend, to feed, to guide to a feeding place.⁴

When David says "The LORD is my _ro'i_" (my shepherd), he uses the possessive form. This is not a statement about God's general character. It is a personal claim. _My_ shepherd. The relationship is direct, intimate, particular.

In the ancient pictographic Hebrew, the letters that form this root tell a story:

- **Resh** (ר) — a head, representing leadership and authority
- **Ayin** (ע) — an eye, representing watching, seeing, knowing⁵

A shepherd is one who leads (_resh_) with eyes (_ayin_) constantly watching. The shepherd sees what the sheep cannot see—the predator in the distance, the cliff edge ahead, the still water just over the hill.

This is not surveillance. It is care. The shepherd's watching is not to catch the sheep doing wrong but to protect them from harm.

> "He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep." (Psalm 121:4)

---

### לֹא אֶחְסָר (Lo Echsar) — I Shall Not Want

The Hebrew verb _chasar_ (חָסַר) means to lack, to be without, to be in need, to decrease.⁶

"I shall not want" is not a statement about having no desires. It is a declaration that with this Shepherd, nothing essential will be missing. The lack—the _chasar_—will not define my existence.

This is a profound reorientation. We spend our lives calculating deficits. What we don't have. What we wish we had. What others have that we lack. Our culture runs on _chasar_—the endless awareness of insufficiency.

David cuts through all of it: _Lo echsar._ With Yahweh as my shepherd, I will not lack.

But notice: David does not say "I do not want" (present tense) but "I _shall_ not want" (future orientation). This is confidence about what is coming, not a denial of present difficulty. David's life was filled with danger, betrayal, and loss. The psalm does not pretend otherwise. It declares that even in the valley of the shadow of death, the Shepherd's presence is enough.

### יְנַהֲלֵנִי (Yenahaleni) — He Leads Me

In verse 2, two different Hebrew words are translated "leads," and the distinction matters.

The first: _yarbitzeni_ (יַרְבִּיצֵנִי) — "He _makes_ me lie down."

This is the Hiphil form of _rabats_, meaning to cause to lie down, to give rest.⁷ It carries a sense of gentle compulsion. The shepherd does not merely offer rest; he creates the conditions where rest becomes possible.

Sheep will not lie down if they are hungry, afraid, or in conflict with other sheep. A skilled shepherd addresses all three: providing food, ensuring safety, maintaining peace in the flock. Only then will sheep rest.⁸

The second: _yenahaleni_ (יְנַהֲלֵנִי) — "He leads me beside still waters."

This word, from _nahal_ (נָהַל), means to lead to a watering place, to guide with care, to bring along gently.⁹ It is used elsewhere of a nursing mother guiding her children (Isaiah 40:11).

The picture is tender. The shepherd does not drive the sheep from behind with shouts and prods. He walks ahead, gently leading, moving at the pace the sheep can follow.

---

### מְנֻחוֹת (Menuchot) — Still Waters

The "still waters" of verse 2 are _menuchot_ in Hebrew—waters of rest, quiet waters.¹⁰

Sheep are afraid of running water. Their wool absorbs water quickly, and they can drown in currents that seem manageable to other animals. A shepherd must find still pools, quiet streams, waters where the sheep can drink without fear.¹¹

God does not lead us to chaos and expect us to thrive. He leads us to _menuchot_—places of rest, quiet spaces where we can drink deeply without drowning.

This does not mean life will be without rapids. It means the Shepherd knows where the still waters are and how to get us there.

---

### נַפְשִׁי יְשׁוֹבֵב (Nafshi Yeshovev) — He Restores My Soul

Here is the heart of the psalm.

_Yeshovev_ comes from the root _shuv_ (שׁוּב), meaning to return, to come back, to restore, to repent.¹² It is the same word used throughout the prophets when God calls Israel to return to him.

"He _shuv_-s my _nephesh_"—he returns my soul.

Returns it from where?

From wandering. From exhaustion. From the far country where we spend ourselves on things that cannot satisfy. The shepherd retrieves what has strayed. He brings back what was lost.

But _yeshovev_ is in the Polel form, an intensive construction. This is not a casual retrieval. It is a thorough restoration—complete, comprehensive, soul-deep.¹³

And _nephesh_? This word is often translated "soul," but in Hebrew it encompasses the entire self: breath, life, desire, the inner being.¹⁴ It is not just the spiritual part of you. It is _you_—your whole exhausted, wandering, wanting self.

The Shepherd brings your entire being back to where it belongs.

## Section B': The Christ Connection — The Remez

### "I Am the Good Shepherd"

Centuries after David wrote Psalm 23, a rabbi from Nazareth stood in Jerusalem and made a staggering claim:

> "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep... I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep." (John 10:11, 14-15)

Jesus was not merely claiming to be _like_ a shepherd. He was claiming to be _the_ Shepherd—the one David had sung about, the one Israel had been waiting for, the one Ezekiel prophesied would come:

> "I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I myself will make them lie down, declares the Lord GOD." (Ezekiel 34:15)

The word "good" in Jesus' statement is the Greek _kalos_ (καλός)—beautiful, noble, excellent, morally good.¹⁵ This is not good as in "adequate." It is good as in "the ideal," "the archetype," "the one all other shepherds were pointing toward."

And notice what makes this Shepherd different from all others: he lays down his life.

Human shepherds might risk their lives for the sheep. They might fight off predators, lose sleep, endure hardship. But they do so to _stay alive_ and continue shepherding. Jesus does something unprecedented: he lays down his life _as_ his act of shepherding. The death itself is the protection. The sacrifice is the provision.¹⁶

---

### The Shepherd Becomes the Lamb

Here is the mystery that makes Christianity unlike any other faith.

The Shepherd does not merely rescue the sheep from death. He enters death himself. He becomes the Lamb—"the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29).

In the Passover, a lamb's blood protected Israel from judgment. In the temple, lambs were sacrificed daily for the sins of the people. The entire sacrificial system pointed toward a final Lamb, a complete sacrifice, a once-for-all offering.

And the Shepherd stepped into that role.

> "For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls." (1 Peter 2:25)

Peter, writing to scattered Christians facing persecution, reaches back to Psalm 23. You were straying. You have _returned_—there's David's _shuv_ again—to the Shepherd.

The Shepherd who died. The Shepherd who rose. The Shepherd who is alive and leading still.

### Still Waters, Living Waters

In John 4, Jesus sits beside a well and offers a Samaritan woman "living water"—water that will become "a spring of water welling up to eternal life" (John 4:14).

In John 7, during the Feast of Tabernacles, Jesus stands and cries out: "If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, 'Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water'" (John 7:37-38).

The still waters of Psalm 23 find their fulfillment in Christ. He is the one who leads us to places of deep rest and soul-satisfying drink. But more than that—he _is_ the water. He does not just show us where to drink; he becomes the drink itself.

This is the Remez, the hint, the connection beneath the surface. Every time David sang of still waters, he was pointing toward a day when the Shepherd himself would say, "Come to me, and you will never thirst again."

## Section A': The Return — Derash and Sod

### What This Means for the Woman in the Parking Lot

Let's return to where we began. The parking lot. The fluorescent lights. The impossible weight of ordinary life.

What does "The LORD is my shepherd" mean for someone who cannot get out of the car?

It means this: the Shepherd is not waiting inside the store for you to pull yourself together. He is in the car with you. He sees the forty-seven tabs. He knows about the 3 AM thoughts. He is not surprised by your inability to do what everyone else seems to manage effortlessly.

_Lo echsar._ You shall not lack.

Not because you will suddenly have more energy, more clarity, more capacity. But because the Shepherd's presence changes the equation. What you lack, he supplies. Where you wander, he retrieves. When you cannot find still waters, he leads you there.

And sometimes—perhaps often—he _makes_ you lie down. Not as punishment, but as grace. The Shepherd knows when the sheep will not rest voluntarily. He creates the conditions. He removes the options. He insists.

That breakdown in the parking lot might be the Shepherd making you lie down.

---

### The Deeper Mystery (Sod)

There is a level of Psalm 23 that goes beyond application, beyond Christology, into mystery.

_The LORD is my shepherd._

In the Hebrew, the word order places emphasis on "LORD" (_Yahweh_). It could be translated: "Yahweh—_he_ is my shepherd."

The emphasis is on identity. Not just what God does, but who God is. The great I AM, the self-existent one, the God who needs nothing and lacks nothing—_he_ shepherds you.

Why?

Not because you are impressive sheep. Not because you have earned good pasture. Not because you navigated your way to still waters on your own merit.

David tells us: "He leads me in paths of righteousness _for his name's sake_."

For his name's sake. For his reputation. For his glory.

The Shepherd's care for you is bound up in his own character. To abandon you would be to deny himself. His name—his very identity—is at stake in your restoration.

This is the deepest rest. Not "God will take care of me because I've been good." But "God will take care of me because he is who he is, and he cannot be otherwise."

---

### The Final Restoration

One day, the _shuv_ will be complete.

Revelation pictures a scene that echoes Psalm 23:

> "For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of living water, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes." (Revelation 7:17)

The Lamb-who-is-Shepherd will lead us to springs of living water. Not still pools for frightened sheep, but abundant springs—water beyond measure, life without end.

Every tear wiped away. Every wandering finished. Every soul fully restored.

This is where the psalm points. Not just to today's parking lot, but to a day when parking lots and fluorescent lights and the weight of wanting will be transformed into something we cannot yet imagine.

Until then, we walk. The Shepherd leads. We follow.

## Breath Prayer

**Inhale:** "The Lord is my shepherd..."
**Exhale:** "...I shall not want."

_Repeat slowly for five breaths. Let the words become your own._

---

## Reflection Questions

1. **What do you lack today?** Not what do you wish you had, but what feels genuinely missing—peace, hope, direction, rest? Bring it before the Shepherd and consider: what would it look like to believe _lo echsar_—that with him, you will not want?

2. **Where is the Shepherd trying to make you lie down?** Is there an area of your life where you resist rest, where you keep pushing despite exhaustion? What would it mean to stop fighting his leading?

3. **How does the Shepherd's motivation ("for his name's sake") change your confidence in his care?** Does it increase your trust to know that his faithfulness depends on his character rather than your performance?
