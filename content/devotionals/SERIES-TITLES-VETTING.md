## Social Media Optimization Notes

### For Maximum Shareability

**Strong openers for social:**

- "3 AM Thoughts" — immediate hook
- "The God Who Naps" — surprising/memorable
- "When You're the Villain" — provocative
- "Honest to God" — permission-giving
- "The Imposter" — universal resonance

**Could be stronger:**

- Add more question-format titles (perform well in feeds)
- Consider adding "Why" titles ("Why You Can't Rest")
- First-person "When I..." titles create intimacy

### Platform-Specific Notes

| Platform  | Best Performing Type           | Our Alignment                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| TikTok    | Short, punchy, emotional hooks | ✅ Many one-word or short titles  |
| Instagram | Aesthetic + relatable quotes   | ✅ Verses pair well with titles   |
| YouTube   | "How to" + longer explanatory  | ⚠️ Could add "How to..." versions |
| Pinterest | Listicle/step-based            | ⚠️ Not our format                 |

---

## Recommended Actions

### 1. Keep As-Is (40+ titles)

Titles like "Running on Empty," "3 AM Thoughts," "Wrestling Match," "The Imposter" — these are search-aligned and socially shareable.

### 2. Revise for Clarity (10-15 titles)

Simplify academic or complex phrasing. See revision suggestions above.

### 3. Add Missing Topics (5-8 new titles)

- Explicit "Hope" title
- "God's Promises" title
- "Waiting" title
- Consider marriage/parenting if targeting those audiences

### 4. Test Before Finalizing

Run 5-10 titles as social posts or ads to see which get highest engagement before committing to full series development.

## Conclusion

**Overall Score: 8.5/10**

The title list is strong. It aligns with major search trends (anxiety, rest, doubt, loneliness, identity) and uses language that performs well on social media (authentic, vulnerable, direct).

Main opportunities:

1. Revise 10-15 titles for clarity
2. Add 5-8 titles covering missing high-volume topics
3. Test top performers before development

The titles successfully avoid churchy clichés and speak to real human experiences — which is exactly what's trending in 2025-2026 faith content.
