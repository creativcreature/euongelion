## Letter Text

Dear Pastor Howard,

My name is [Your Name], and I am the founder of Euangelion (euangelion.app), a Christian devotional application that provides daily Scripture-based spiritual formation content for people seeking depth in their faith.

I am writing to request your permission to include excerpts from your published writings in our app. Euangelion curates high-quality Christian content—80% drawn from credentialed pastoral and theological voices, and 20% lightly shaped with AI assistance. All content is attributed to its author with full citations and direct links to the original source.

We specifically admire your work on [healthy church leadership / pastoral formation / Christian life] and believe your voice would serve our readers well. We are a for-profit application, so I want to be transparent and obtain your explicit permission before including any of your content.

**What we are requesting permission to use:**

- Select excerpts (typically 1-5 paragraphs) from your published articles at Baptist News Global, The Christian Century, and/or your blog at barrysnotes.wordpress.com
- All excerpts would be quoted verbatim, without alteration
- Full attribution: your name, title of article, publication name, date, and a direct link to the original

**How it would be used:**

- As source material for devotional content, cited within the app
- In a curated theological reference library used to generate devotional writing

If you are open to this, I would also love to discuss what content of yours you feel is most representative of your voice and ministry priorities.

Please feel free to respond via email at [your-email] or call me at [phone]. I am happy to provide any additional information you need.

With gratitude for your ministry,

[Your Name]
Founder, Euangelion
