## Letter Text

Dear Pastor Head,

My name is [Your Name], and I am the founder of Euangelion (euangelion.app), a Christian devotional application designed to help people encounter Scripture more deeply through high-quality, spiritually grounded content.

I am writing to request your permission to include excerpts from your sermons and teachings in our app. Euangelion curates pastoral content from credentialed voices across Christian traditions, presenting it with full attribution and direct links to the original source. Our goal is to put excellent teaching in front of people seeking genuine formation—not entertainment.

I have had the privilege of knowing you personally and have been shaped by your ministry. I believe your preaching would be an asset to the readers we serve.

**What we are requesting permission to use:**

- Select excerpts (typically 1-5 paragraphs) from your published sermon transcripts or recordings available at fbroswell.org
- All excerpts would be quoted verbatim, without alteration
- Full attribution: your name, sermon title, date, and a direct link to the original recording/transcript

**How it would be used:**

- As source material for devotional content, cited within the app
- In a curated theological reference library used to inform devotional writing

Euangelion is a for-profit application, and I want to be fully transparent about that before requesting your blessing. I would also welcome the chance to discuss what teachings you feel are most central to your ministry voice.

Please reply at your convenience to [your-email] or reach me at [phone].

With gratitude and respect,

[Your Name]
Founder, Euangelion
euangelion.app
