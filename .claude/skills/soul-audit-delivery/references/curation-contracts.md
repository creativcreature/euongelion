# Curation Contracts

## Curated-first composition

- Source priority: `content/approved` -> `content/final` -> `content/series-json`.
- Missing curated core should fail closed for publish/render.
- Generation is assistive (bridge/reflection/prayer polish), not primary.

## Output behavior

- 3 primary AI-assisted curated options.
- 2 secondary curated prefab options.
- Option labels/titles should be specific to user audit input.
