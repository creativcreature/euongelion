# Gate Checklist

## Must-pass gates

1. Functional: key flows work end to end.
2. Quality: lint/type/test/build pass.
3. Tracking: production contracts and feature PRD checks pass.
4. UX: no overflow, nav works, dark mode parity, interaction affordance clear.
5. Security: no secrets exposed, consent/analytics behavior correct.
