# App Store Ops

## iOS prep focus

- App Store Connect account readiness
- semantic version + incremented build number
- privacy manifest and permission descriptions
- metadata completeness (privacy/support URLs, category, age rating)
- screenshot and review-note readiness

## Submission evidence

- attach checklist completion
- include demo credentials (if required)
- document non-obvious reviewer paths
