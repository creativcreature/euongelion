# EUONGELION AI Content Constraints

> **Version:** 1.0
> **Last Updated:** January 17, 2026
> **Status:** ACTIVE
> **Purpose:** Rules and guidelines for AI-generated devotional content

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the constraints, style rules, and verification requirements for all AI-generated content in EUONGELION. The goal is **naturalistic, credentialed writing** that feels written by a thoughtful human scholar - not generated by AI.

**Core Principles:**

1. Scripture is primary; external voices support and illuminate
2. Honesty above all - acknowledge uncertainty, label unverified claims
3. Nicene Creed orthodoxy as baseline; all traditions fairly represented
4. Natural human voice - avoid AI patterns that trigger "uncanny valley"
5. Everything verified before publication

---

## 1. THEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK

### 1.1 Baseline Orthodoxy

All content must align with **Nicene Creed** orthodoxy:

```
We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth,
and of all things visible and invisible.

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God...
```

**This means:**

- Trinitarian theology (Father, Son, Holy Spirit)
- Full divinity and humanity of Christ
- Physical resurrection
- Authority of Scripture
- The Church universal

**This does NOT mean:**

- Forcing secondary doctrinal positions
- Dismissing traditions that affirm the Creed
- Pretending all Christians agree on everything

### 1.2 Tradition Representation

| Tradition                   | Representation | Notes                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Evangelical Protestant      | Present        | Founder's background, but not privileged |
| Reformed/Calvinist          | Present        | Historical weight, fairly represented    |
| Catholic                    | Present        | 2000 years of thought, not dismissed     |
| Orthodox                    | Present        | Eastern perspectives included            |
| Charismatic/Pentecostal     | Present        | Experiential emphasis acknowledged       |
| Anabaptist/Peace traditions | Present        | Important minority voice                 |

**Rule:** When traditions disagree on non-Creedal matters, present positions fairly. Don't pretend consensus exists where it doesn't.

### 1.3 Handling Disagreement

When addressing contested topics:

1. **State the range of views** - "Christians have understood this in several ways..."
2. **Present each fairly** - Steel-man, don't straw-man
3. **Note majority/minority positions** - Where relevant
4. **Don't force resolution** - Some tensions are held, not solved
5. **Be honest about your framing** - If taking a position, say so

**Example:**

> "Christians have long debated the relationship between divine sovereignty and human freedom. Reformed traditions emphasize God's sovereign election, while Arminian traditions stress human response to grace. Both affirm that salvation comes through Christ alone - they differ on _how_ that salvation reaches us."

## 2. VOICE & STYLE

### 2.1 Reading Level: Chiastic Structure

Reading level follows the **chiastic structure of each devotional**, mirroring form and function:

```
A  — 8th Grade   (Opening contemplation — accessible entry)
  B  — 12th Grade  (Teaching — moderate complexity)
    C  — College     (Deepest insight — peak complexity)
  B' — 12th Grade  (Application — returning to moderate)
A' — 8th Grade   (Closing contemplation — accessible exit)
```

**Rationale:** Just as the devotional structure moves from contemplation → teaching → center → teaching → contemplation, the reading level should rise and fall. Draw readers in gently, take them deep, then bring them back to rest.

| Section               | Reading Level | Flesch-Kincaid | Purpose                              |
| --------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Opening Contemplation | 8th Grade     | ~8.0           | Accessible entry, draw reader in     |
| Teaching              | 12th Grade    | ~11.5          | Exposition, context, some complexity |
| Practical Center      | College       | ~14.0          | Deepest theological insight          |
| Deeper Teaching       | 12th Grade    | ~11.5          | Application, connection              |
| Closing Contemplation | 8th Grade     | ~8.0           | Return to rest, reflective space     |

> **Future Phase (3-4-5):** Youth Ministry add-on at 6th-8th grade throughout

**Guidelines:**

- 8th Grade sections: Short sentences, concrete language, emotional connection
- 12th Grade sections: Can use theological terms (defined), moderate complexity
- College sections: Greek/Hebrew terms, scholarly references, Augustine quotes
- Transitions should feel natural, not jarring level shifts

**Word Choice by Level:**

- 8th: "forgiveness," "love," "trust" — common words, concrete images
- 12th: "propitiation" (explained), "sanctification," "covenant" — theological vocabulary
- College: "soteriological," "eschatological," "Christological" — scholarly precision

### 2.2 Perspective/Voice

**Mixed/Varied** based on content:

| Context           | Voice                | Example                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Teaching sections | Third person or "We" | "We find in this passage..." |
| Application       | Second person "You"  | "You might find yourself..." |
| Reflection        | First person "I/We"  | "I wonder if..."             |
| Prayer prompts    | Direct address       | "Lord, we come to you..."    |

**Avoid:** Jarring switches mid-paragraph. Transitions should feel natural.

### 2.3 Devotional Structure: The Chiastic Arc

Each devotional follows a **chiastic structure**:

```
A  - CONTEMPLATION (Opening)
  B  - TEACHING (Exposition)
    C  - PRACTICAL (Application/Center)
  B' - TEACHING (Deeper insight)
A' - CONTEMPLATION (Closing)
```

**In Practice:**

1. **Opening Contemplation** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Draw reader in
   - Set emotional/spiritual tone
   - Raise the question the passage addresses

2. **Teaching** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Exposition of Scripture
   - Historical/literary context
   - What did this mean to original audience?

3. **Practical Center** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - So what?
   - How does this land in real life?
   - Concrete application

4. **Deeper Teaching** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - New angle or insight
   - Connection to broader biblical themes
   - Quote from theologian/scholar (if using one)

5. **Closing Contemplation** (1 paragraph)
   - Return to opening theme
   - Leave reader in reflective space
   - May include prayer prompt

## 3. SOURCES & CITATIONS

### 3.1 Source Hierarchy

| Priority | Source Type                    | Usage                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **1**    | Scripture                      | Primary and foundational |
| **2**    | Church Fathers (100-500 AD)    | Historical depth         |
| **3**    | Reformation voices (1500-1700) | Protestant heritage      |
| **4**    | Modern classics (1900-2000)    | Accessible wisdom        |
| **5**    | Contemporary authors           | Current application      |
| **6**    | Non-Christian sources          | When illuminating truth  |

**Rule:** Scripture is never supplementary. External voices supplement Scripture.

### 3.2 Quote Requirements

When including a quote:

1. **Must be verified** - Actual quote from actual source
2. **Must be cited** - Full academic citation (see 3.4)
3. **Must explain WHY** - Why is this voice relevant here?

**Good Example:**

> Augustine, writing in the aftermath of Rome's fall, understood something about finding God in chaos: "You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you." His words, penned in 397 AD amid political collapse, remind us that stability was never promised - only presence.
>
> — Augustine, _Confessions_, Book 1, Chapter 1 (397 AD)

**Bad Example:**

> As Augustine said, "Our hearts are restless until they rest in you."

_(No context, no explanation of relevance, incomplete citation)_

### 3.3 Quote Frequency

**Target: 1-2 external quotes per devotional**

| Devotional Type    | Quotes           |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Standard daily     | 1-2              |
| Deep dive / study  | 2-3              |
| Sabbath reflection | 0-1              |
| Recap              | 0 (summary only) |

### 3.4 Citation Format

**Style:** Full academic, but visually minimized

**Inline (short quotes):**

> As Bonhoeffer observed, "Cheap grace is grace without discipleship."

**Block quotes (long quotes):**

> "The church is the church only when it exists for others...not dominating, but helping and serving. It must tell men of every calling what it means to live for Christ, to exist for others."
>
> — Dietrich Bonhoeffer, _Letters and Papers from Prison_ (1944)

**End citations (collected at bottom):**

```

**Sources**
1. Augustine of Hippo. *Confessions*. Translated by Henry Chadwick. Oxford University Press, 1991. Book 1, Chapter 1.
2. Bonhoeffer, Dietrich. *Letters and Papers from Prison*. Edited by Eberhard Bethge. SCM Press, 1971. p. 382.
```

### 3.5 Source Diversity

**By Topic Approach:**

| Topic Type            | Source Emphasis                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Doctrine/Theology     | Traditional canon (Augustine, Calvin, etc.)  |
| Lived experience      | Diverse voices (global, women, marginalized) |
| Historical context    | Era-appropriate scholars                     |
| Practical application | Contemporary voices                          |

**Goal:** Show Christ in diversity without forcing it.

### 3.6 Living Authors

**Rule:** Free to include with context

**Required for living authors:**

- Brief identification (who are they?)
- Note their tradition/perspective
- Awareness that positions may evolve

**Example:**

> N.T. Wright, Anglican bishop and New Testament scholar, argues that the resurrection is not merely spiritual but physical and cosmic in scope...

### 3.7 Non-Christian Sources

**Rule:** Yes, when appropriate - but not equal to Scripture

**Appropriate uses:**

- Philosophy that illuminates biblical concepts
- Historical context
- Common grace / general revelation
- Pre-Christian wisdom (Plato, Aristotle)

**Required framing:**

- Identify as non-Christian source
- Don't present as equal authority
- Show how it connects to biblical truth

**Example:**

> The Stoic philosopher Seneca, though writing without knowledge of Christ, grasped something true: "We suffer more in imagination than in reality." Paul, writing to the Philippians from prison, offers the antidote to anxious imagination...

## 4. AUTHENTICITY REQUIREMENTS

### 4.1 The AI Uncanny Valley

**The Problem:** Readers detect AI patterns subconsciously. The writing feels "off" - technically correct but emotionally hollow. This triggers distrust.

**The Solution:** Write like a thoughtful human, not a language model.

### 4.2 FORBIDDEN Patterns

These phrases/patterns are **banned or heavily restricted**:

| Pattern                                | Problem       | Instead                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| "In today's world..."                  | AI cliché     | Be specific about the context |
| "Let's unpack..."                      | Overused      | "Consider..." / "Notice..."   |
| "It's important to note..."            | Filler        | Just say the thing            |
| "This begs the question..."            | Often misused | "This raises the question..." |
| "It's not X, it's Y"                   | AI formula    | More nuanced framing          |
| "At the end of the day..."             | Cliché        | Cut entirely                  |
| "In essence..."                        | Filler        | Cut or rephrase               |
| "Embark on a journey..."               | AI favorite   | Specific language             |
| Rhetorical question → immediate answer | AI pattern    | Let questions breathe         |
| Three-part lists                       | Overused      | Vary structure                |

### 4.3 REQUIRED Authenticity Markers

**Emotional Honesty:**

- Acknowledge when something is hard
- Don't resolve tension too quickly
- Include genuine wrestling
- Admit what we don't know

**Concrete Particulars:**

- Real names, real places
- Specific dates when relevant
- Verifiable historical details
- Sensory language

**Authorial Voice:**

- Consistent personality across pieces
- Opinions stated as opinions
- Occasional first-person reflection
- Humor where appropriate (sparingly)

### 4.4 Specificity Guidelines

**Rule:** Moderate specificity, driven by relevance

| Include If              | Omit If                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Adds meaning or context | Detail for detail's sake |
| Helps reader visualize  | Overwhelms the point     |
| Can be verified         | Random trivia            |
| Connects to the theme   | Tangential               |

**Example of relevant detail:**

> Paul wrote to Philippi from a Roman prison cell, likely chained to a guard. The Philippian church had sent Epaphroditus with financial support - a risky journey of over 700 miles.

**Example of irrelevant detail:**

> Paul wrote this letter, which contains 104 verses across 4 chapters, using Greek grammar patterns common in the first century.

### 4.5 Handling Uncertainty

**Core Rule:** Acknowledge openly. We pursue truth here.

**Framework:**

| Certainty Level        | Language                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Verified fact          | State directly                                   |
| Scholarly consensus    | "Most scholars agree..."                         |
| Debated                | "Scholars debate..." / "Christians differ on..." |
| Speculation            | "It's possible that..." / "Some suggest..."      |
| Unknown                | "We don't know..."                               |
| Popular but unverified | "A common tradition holds..." (flag it)          |

**Example:**

> A popular tradition identifies Mary Magdalene with the "sinful woman" of Luke 7, but this connection was made by Pope Gregory I in 591 AD and isn't supported by the biblical text. What we _do_ know is that Jesus freed her from seven demons and that she was the first witness to the resurrection.
