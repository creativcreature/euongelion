# M05 - Self-Service UX Method

## Focus

Users must quickly complete account/self-service tasks without support burden.

## Euangelion adaptation

1. Devotional home must expose Today, Bookmarks, Archive in stable order.
2. Support hub must provide direct recovery paths.
3. Privacy, data export, and lifecycle settings must be discoverable and understandable.
