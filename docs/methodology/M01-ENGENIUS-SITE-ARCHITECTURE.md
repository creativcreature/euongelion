# M01 - Site Architecture Method

## Focus

Clear hierarchy, shallow findability depth, and structured page relationships.

## Euangelion adaptation

1. Route architecture must preserve top-level intent clarity.
2. Core paths must avoid deep nesting and ambiguous labels.
3. Internal linking must support both first-time and returning users.
