**Preview Text:** After months of work, EUONGELION is live.

**Body:**

We started with a question: What would honest faith content look like?

Not the kind that shouts. Not the slick, marketed Christianity that makes skeptics roll their eyes. Something that meets people where they actually are.

Today, that question has an answer.

**EUONGELION is live.**

Daily readings. Deep but not long. For the person who drifted, the person who's stuck, the person who leads others but hasn't been led in years.

No accounts. No tracking. No pressure to perform.

Just content worth your time.

**wokegod.world**

See you there.

**Body:**

---

Daily readings for the seeking heart.

#### Launch Day Post

**Version A**

```
Today, we're launching EUONGELION.

It's a daily devotional platform for professionals and leaders who are spiritually hungry but time-poor.

What makes it different:
- 5-minute daily readings, not hour-long commitments
- Deep content—Scripture, original languages, stories that connect to real life
- No accounts required. No tracking. Privacy-first design.

If you've ever felt like your spiritual life got pushed aside by your professional life—this is for you.

Or if you know someone who needs a quiet place to think about what matters—send them this link.

wokegod.world
```

---

**Version B**

```
Busyness isn't just a schedule problem. It's a spiritual one.

When your calendar rules your heart, something's wrong.

We built EUONGELION for people who know this but don't know what to do about it.

Daily readings. 5 minutes. Deep content. No pressure.

wokegod.world
```

---

**Version C**

```
We launched something today.

EUONGELION is daily devotional content for people who believe, used to believe, or want to believe but have questions.

#### Day 2 Follow-Up

```

---

**Version B**

```
One day in, and we're already hearing from professionals who said:

"I forgot what it felt like to slow down."
"This is the first 5 minutes I've taken for myself in weeks."

If that resonates—give it a try.

```

**Version C**

```

---

**Version B**

```
If EUONGELION has been meaningful this week, I have one request:

Think about who in your network needs it.

The burned-out leader. The person who drifted from faith. The one who's too busy to slow down.

Send them the link. That's it.

wokegod.world
```

---

**Version C**

```
A week ago, we asked: "What are you wrestling with today?"

Now: What's shifted for you?

Comment with your honest answer.

## Notes for Implementation

1. **Visual Consistency:** All social images should use brand colors (Tehom Black #1A1612, Scroll White #F7F3ED, God is Gold #C19A6B)

2. **Hashtag Strategy:**
   - Instagram: 5-10 hashtags, mix of broad (#Faith) and specific (#DailyDevotional)
   - Twitter: 1-2 hashtags maximum
   - Facebook: Minimal or none
   - LinkedIn: None

3. **Testing Approach:**
   - Test Version A vs B on first platform
   - Use winner as baseline for remaining platforms
   - Track: Click-through rate, engagement rate, conversions (series starts)

4. **Timing:**
   - Launch Day: Post between 8-9am EST for maximum reach
   - Day 2: Post between 7-8am EST (catches morning routines)
   - Week 1: Post between 6-8pm EST (reflective time)
