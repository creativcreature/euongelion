# EUONGELION Referral Program

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** January 17, 2026
**Target Launch:** wokegod.world

---

## Overview

The EUONGELION Referral Program encourages organic sharing by rewarding users who invite others to the platform. The program is designed to feel natural, not transactional—aligned with our mission of shepherding people to Jesus, not acquiring users.

**Core Philosophy:**
Sharing should feel like helping a friend, not selling a product. Rewards are appreciation, not compensation.

---

## Program Mechanics

### How It Works

1. **User completes their first series** (5 days)
2. **User is offered a unique referral link**
3. **User shares link with friends, family, or online**
4. **When someone clicks the link and completes Day 1**, the referrer receives credit
5. **Credits unlock rewards** (see Rewards section)

---

### What Triggers Credit

| Action by Referred User         | Credit to Referrer        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Clicks referral link            | No credit (just tracking) |
| Starts Soul Audit               | No credit                 |
| Completes Day 1                 | **1 credit**              |
| Completes first series (5 days) | **Bonus: +2 credits**     |
| Creates account                 | **Bonus: +1 credit**      |

**Total potential per referral:** 4 credits

**Rationale:**

- We don't reward clicks—those don't indicate genuine interest
- Day 1 completion shows real engagement
- Series completion shows sustained value
- Account creation indicates ongoing relationship

---

### Referral Link Structure

**Format:**

```
wokegod.world/?ref=[unique_code]
```

**Unique Code:**

- 8-character alphanumeric
- Generated upon first referral link request
- Persistent across sessions (tied to user ID if account created)

**Example:**

```
wokegod.world/?ref=grace7xk
```

**For Users Without Accounts:**

- Link stored in local storage
- Prompt to create account to maintain referral history

### Why No Cash Rewards

**Philosophical Alignment:**

- EUONGELION is about shepherding, not selling
- Cash incentives create transactional relationships
- We want referrals from genuine belief, not commission-seeking

**Practical Benefit:**

- Avoids affiliate marketing reputation
- Attracts quality referrals (people who actually care)
- Simpler compliance (no tax implications for users)

## FAQ for Users

**Q: Do I need an account to share?**
A: No. You can get a referral link without an account. But creating an account lets you track your impact over time.

**Q: How do I know someone used my link?**
A: We'll email you when someone completes Day 1. You won't know who—just that your sharing mattered.

**Q: Do my credits expire?**
A: No. Credits are permanent.

**Q: Can I cash out my credits?**
A: No. Credits unlock non-monetary rewards—early access, exclusive content, and recognition.

**Q: What if I share without a link?**
A: We can only track referrals through your unique link. Word-of-mouth matters too—we just can't measure it.

**Q: Is this an MLM?**
A: No. You don't earn from your referrals' referrals. There's no "downline." It's simple: you share, they engage, you get appreciated.
