## Email 1: T-7 (Coming Soon Teaser)

**Subject Line:** Something's coming

**Preview Text:** We've been building something for people like you.

---

**Body:**

Hi,

We've been quiet lately. Working on something.

In seven days, we're launching EUONGELION.

**What is it?**

A daily devotional platform for people who believe, used to believe, or want to believe but have questions.

**What makes it different?**

- Short readings. 5 minutes, not 50.
- Deep content. Hebrew word studies. Greek roots. Stories that actually connect.
- No accounts required. No tracking. Just content worth your time.

We built this for the person who drifted and doesn't know how to come back. For the believer who's stuck in routine. For the leader who feeds everyone else but never gets fed.

We built this for you.

**Mark your calendar:** [LAUNCH DATE]

More details coming soon.

---

Grace and peace,

The EUONGELION Team

wokegod.world (coming soon)

---

**Design Notes:**

- Simple, text-focused layout
- Single brand image or logo at top
- No buttons yet (building anticipation, not driving action)

---

## Email 2: T-3 (What to Expect)

**Subject Line:** What to expect

**Preview Text:** Four days away. Here's how this works.

---

**Body:**

Hi,

Four days until launch. Here's what you're getting into.

**How EUONGELION works:**

1. **The Soul Audit**

   When you arrive, you'll answer one question: _"What are you wrestling with today?"_

   Write whatever's honest. A sentence. A paragraph. Whatever comes. No one but you sees it.

   Based on what you share, we'll match you with content that speaks to where you are.

2. **Your Series**

   Each series is 5 days. One reading per day. Short enough for busy lives, deep enough to be worth your time.

   Content unlocks daily. Not because we're gatekeeping—because some things need time to settle.

3. **The Reading Experience**

   Every day includes:
   - Scripture (with context you might have missed)
   - Hebrew or Greek word studies
   - A story that connects
   - A reflection question
   - A breath prayer or practice

   It's designed to be read slowly. Let it work in you.

**What you won't find:**

- Accounts or sign-ups (unless you want to save progress)
- Tracking or data collection
- Guilt trips or manipulation
- Slick, marketed Christianity

Just honest content for the seeking heart.

**Launch date:** [LAUNCH DATE]

We'll be in your inbox that morning.

---

Grace and peace,

The EUONGELION Team

---

**Design Notes:**

- Slightly longer format to set expectations
- Simple numbered list for clarity
- Optional: Include a preview image of the reading experience

---

## Email 3: T-1 (Tomorrow Is the Day)

**Subject Line:** Tomorrow

**Preview Text:** EUONGELION goes live in the morning.

---

**Body:**

Hi,

Tomorrow morning, EUONGELION goes live.

No long email today. Just a few things:

**If you're ready to start:** Check your inbox tomorrow at 7am.

**If you're nervous:** That's okay. Faith has always been hard to hold. You're not the first to struggle.

**If you're skeptical:** We understand. We built this for skeptics too. Give it one day. See how it sits.

**If you're not ready:** That's okay too. The content will be there when you are.

Tomorrow, we'll send you the link. One click. No friction.

See you in the morning.

---

Grace and peace,

The EUONGELION Team

---

**Design Notes:**

- Short, focused, emotional
- White space for breathing room
- Single brand image or simple graphic

---

## Email 4: Launch Day (It's Live)

**Subject Line:** We're live

**Preview Text:** EUONGELION is here. Start when you're ready.

---

**Body:**

Hi,

Today is the day.

**EUONGELION is live.** [wokegod.world](https://wokegod.world)

---

**Here's how to start:**

1. Go to wokegod.world
2. Answer one question honestly
3. Start your first reading

That's it. Five minutes. No account needed.

---

**What you'll find:**

Daily readings for people who believe, used to believe, or want to believe but have questions.

Short enough for busy lives. Deep enough to be worth your time.

---

**Ready?**

[Start Reading →](https://wokegod.world)

---

If now isn't the right moment—that's okay. The content will be here when you are.

But if something brought you this far, maybe today is the day.

---

Grace and peace,

The EUONGELION Team

P.S. — If EUONGELION lands with you, consider sharing it with someone else. Not for us. For them.

---

**Design Notes:**

- Clear, prominent CTA button
- Minimal text, maximum clarity
- Mobile-optimized button sizing

---

## Email 5: T+1 (First Day Feedback)

**Subject Line:** How was it?

**Preview Text:** Day 1 is done. We want to hear from you.

---

**Body:**

Hi,

If you started yesterday—thank you.

**Day 2 is ready.** Same place. [wokegod.world](https://wokegod.world)

Before you dive back in, we have a question:

**How was Day 1?**

We want to hear from you. What landed? What surprised you? What didn't work?

Hit reply and tell us. We read every response.

---

**If you haven't started yet:**

No judgment. Today works just as well.

Some people need a running start. Some need a slow walk. Both are fine.

[Start Reading →](https://wokegod.world)

---

**A small request:**

If Day 1 meant something to you, think about who else needs it.

The friend who drifted.
The colleague who's burned out.
The family member who stopped going to church.

Send them the link. That's it.

[wokegod.world](https://wokegod.world)

---

Grace and peace,

The EUONGELION Team

---

**Design Notes:**

- Emphasize reply mechanism for feedback
- Two distinct sections for "started" vs "haven't started"
- Soft referral ask (not pushy)

---

## Email 6: T+3 (Week 1 Check-In)

**Subject Line:** Still with us?

**Preview Text:** One week of EUONGELION. What's shifting?

---

**Body:**

Hi,

It's been almost a week since EUONGELION launched.

Some of you have read every day. Some of you read once and haven't come back yet. Both are okay.

**If you're still with us:**

Thank you. You're part of something we've been building for a long time.

Here's what we've heard this week:

> "I haven't felt this way about Scripture in years."

> "This is exactly what I needed. How did you know?"

> "I started just to try it. Now I'm hooked."

Your experience matters to us. If you have feedback—what's working, what's not—hit reply. We read everything.

---

**If you started and stopped:**

That's okay. Life happens.

Here's what we'd say: Don't feel guilty about it. Just come back when you're ready.

The content will be there. Day 1 or Day 5 or Day 1 again—wherever you are.

[Continue Reading →](https://wokegod.world)

---

**If you haven't started:**

Still no judgment.

But if something keeps bringing you back to these emails... maybe that's worth paying attention to.

[Start Reading →](https://wokegod.world)

---

Grace and peace,

The EUONGELION Team

---

**Design Notes:**

- Include 2-3 short testimonials (real, with permission)
- Three distinct sections for different user states
- Warm, non-judgmental tone throughout

---

## Email 7: T+7 (Share Your Experience)

**Subject Line:** Share your experience

**Preview Text:** One week complete. We need your help.

---

**Body:**

Hi,

It's been one week since EUONGELION launched.

If you've been reading, you've been part of something meaningful. Thank you.

Today, we're asking for your help.

---

**We need your story.**

Not a polished testimonial. Just your honest experience.

- What brought you to EUONGELION?
- What's landed for you this week?
- Has anything shifted in how you think about faith, Scripture, or prayer?

Hit reply and tell us. Even a few sentences.

Your words might be exactly what someone else needs to hear before they take the first step.

---

**We need your share.**

You probably know someone who needs this.

The friend who drifted from faith.
The parent who's burned out.
The coworker who asked a spiritual question once.
The person who's been searching at 2am.

Send them this link: [wokegod.world](https://wokegod.world)

Or forward this email. Or screenshot your favorite reading and text it to them.

Whatever feels natural. Just share.

---

**What's next:**

More content is coming. New series. Deeper dives. We're building this one day at a time.

If there's a topic you want us to cover—grief, doubt, marriage, work, parenting, whatever—reply and tell us. We're building this for you.

---

Thank you for being part of week one. It's just the beginning.

---

Grace and peace,

The EUONGELION Team

P.S. — If you want to support EUONGELION beyond sharing, we'll have more to announce soon. For now, the best thing you can do is tell someone.

---

**Design Notes:**

- Strong emphasis on reply mechanism
- Clear share request with specific examples
- Forward-looking (more content coming)
- Hint at future support options without hard sell

## Segmentation Notes

Consider creating alternate versions for:

**1. Engaged Users (opened T-0, clicked)**

- T+1: Focus on Day 2, ask for specific feedback
- T+3: Request testimonial
- T+7: Emphasize sharing, hint at referral program

**2. Unengaged Users (received but didn't open/click)**

- T+1: Re-send launch email with new subject line
- T+3: "We noticed you haven't started" — no guilt, just invitation
- T+7: Final gentle nudge, then reduce frequency

**3. Power Users (completed 5+ days)**

- T+7: Request to become ambassador/beta tester for new content
- Invite to early access for new series

---

## Design Guidelines

**Brand Consistency:**

- Colors: Tehom Black (#1A1612), Scroll White (#F7F3ED), God is Gold (#C19A6B)

- Logo: Top of email, small, not dominating

**Layout Principles:**

- Mobile-first design (60%+ will read on mobile)
- Single column, max-width 600px
- Generous white space
- CTA buttons: 44px minimum height, full-width on mobile

**Tone Markers:**

- Sign-off: "Grace and peace" (not "Blessings" or "God bless")
- Signature: "The EUONGELION Team" (humble, collective)
- Never use exclamation points in subject lines
