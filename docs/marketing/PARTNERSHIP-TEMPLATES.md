# EUONGELION Partnership Outreach Templates

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** January 17, 2026
**Target Launch:** wokegod.world

---

## Overview

This document contains email templates for partnership outreach across five key categories:

1. Churches
2. Ministries/Parachurch Organizations
3. Christian Influencers
4. Podcast Hosts
5. Authors

Each category includes an initial outreach email, follow-up template, and partnership proposal framework.

**Voice:** Warm, professional, never salesy. Peer-to-peer, not vendor-to-customer. We're offering value, not asking for favors.

---

## General Principles

**Before You Send:**

1. **Research first.** Know who you're writing to. Mention something specific about their work.

2. **Lead with value.** What do we offer them? Not what do we want from them.

3. **Be brief.** Busy people don't read long emails. Get to the point.

4. **Make it easy.** Clear ask. Easy next step. No friction.

5. **Follow up once.** If no response after 7 days, one gentle follow-up. Then move on.

**Universal Replacements:**

- [RECIPIENT NAME] — Their first name
- [ORGANIZATION/MINISTRY NAME] — Their organization
- [SPECIFIC WORK REFERENCE] — Something they created you admire
- [YOUR NAME] — Sender's name
- [LAUNCH DATE] — When EUONGELION goes live

---

## 1. Churches

### Initial Outreach

**Subject:** A resource for your congregation

---

Hi [PASTOR/LEADER NAME],

I'm reaching out because I've seen the work [CHURCH NAME] does, and I think there might be a way we can support it.

I'm part of the team behind EUONGELION (wokegod.world)—a free daily devotional platform launching [LAUNCH DATE]. It's designed for people who believe, used to believe, or want to believe but have questions.

**Why I'm writing you:**

Churches do incredible work with the people who show up. But there are others—the ones who drifted, the skeptical spouse, the college student who stopped coming—who aren't walking through your doors. EUONGELION is designed to meet those people where they are.

**What we offer:**

- Free daily devotional content (no accounts required)
- Deep theological teaching (Hebrew/Greek word studies, historical context)
- Content that respects intelligence without requiring seminary training
- A gentle on-ramp for people who aren't ready for church but are spiritually hungry

**What we're not:**

We're not trying to replace church. We're trying to extend your reach to people you can't currently access.

**Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore how EUONGELION might serve your congregation?**

If not, no pressure. But if you know someone in your community who's drifted—feel free to share wokegod.world with them. That's what it's for.

Grace and peace,

[YOUR NAME]
EUONGELION Team

If a brief conversation would be helpful, I'm happy to connect. If not, no worries—just wanted to make sure this didn't get buried.
