| **3** | Twitter   | TH   | 1/ εὐαγγέλιον. That's the word our platform is named after. Here's what it means... 2/ In Greek, it literally means "good news." But it wasn't originally a religious word. 3/ Roman soldiers used it. When a king won a battle, messengers ran back shouting: εὐαγγέλιον! The war is over! 4/ Early Christians grabbed this word and said: That's what Jesus did. The battle is over. The King has won. 5/ That's why we're here. To remind people the war is over—even when it doesn't feel like it. wokegod.world |
