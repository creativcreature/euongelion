## The Core Truth

We're not building for "users." We're building for **lost sheep finding their way home**.

These are real people in real situations. The pathways (Sleep, Awake, Shepherd) are internal tools — externally, we meet people as people, not categories.

---

## Who We're Building For

### The Drifted

**Who they are:**

- Once had faith, now distant
- Didn't leave dramatically — just slowly stopped showing up
- Too busy, too tired, too distracted to notice they drifted
- Feel guilty about it but don't know how to come back
- Ages 25-45, often professionals, parents, or both

**What they feel:**

- "I used to pray, but I don't even know how anymore"
- "I believe in God, I just don't... do anything about it"
- "Church feels irrelevant to my actual life"
- "I'm too far gone / too busy / too tired"

**What they need:**

- A low-pressure re-entry point
- Content that speaks to real life, not church culture
- Permission to start small
- No judgment for where they've been

---

### The Skeptical Seeker

**Who they are:**

- Spiritually curious but wary of religion
- May have been hurt by church or Christians
- Deconstructing or post-evangelical
- Intellectually engaged, allergic to simplistic answers
- Often younger (20s-30s), educated, urban

**What they feel:**

- "I'm spiritual but not religious"
- "The church is hypocritical / irrelevant / harmful"
- "I have questions no one will answer honestly"
- "I want something real, not performance"

**What they need:**

- Honesty about hard questions
- Intellectual respect — don't dumb it down
- No manipulation, no guilt trips
- Space to explore without commitment pressure

---

### The Stuck Believer

**Who they are:**

- Committed Christians going through the motions
- Faith feels dry, routine, obligatory
- Know they should feel more but don't
- May be burned out from church service
- All ages, often long-time church attenders

**What they feel:**

- "I believe, but I don't feel anything"
- "My quiet time is just checking a box"
- "I'm spiritually stuck and don't know why"
- "There has to be more than this"

**What they need:**

- Fresh perspective on familiar truths
- Depth they haven't encountered
- Challenge without condemnation
- Rekindled wonder

---

### The Weary Shepherd

**Who they are:**

- Pastors, ministry leaders, small group leaders
- Those who feed others but aren't fed themselves
- Isolated in their struggles (can't be vulnerable with their flock)
- Exhausted from giving constantly
- Often middle-aged, in ministry 5+ years

**What they feel:**

- "I pour out but no one pours into me"
- "I'm supposed to have it together"
- "I'm lonely in leadership"
- "I need someone to shepherd me"

**What they need:**

- Content that feeds the feeder
- Permission to be struggling
- Deeper theological engagement
- Tools to extend their own shepherding

## How This Maps to Internal Pathways

| Audience             | Internal Pathway | Content Approach                                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| The Stuck Believer   | Awake            | Challenge complacency, fresh angles on familiar texts, rekindle fire   |
| The Weary Shepherd   | Shepherd         | Dense theological content, permission to struggle, equipping focus     |

**Note:** Pathway labels are NEVER shown to users. They inform content creation, not user-facing experience.

---

## The Person We're Ultimately Serving

Underneath all segments is one person:

**Someone who was made for relationship with God, has drifted or never found it, and needs a path back home.**

We're not acquiring users. We're extending a shepherd's reach to find lost sheep.
