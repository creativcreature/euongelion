# EUONGELION Social Shareability Framework

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** January 17, 2026
**Purpose:** Strategic framework for creating shareable social content from devotional material

---

## Overview

EUONGELION content is designed for depth. But depth doesn't spread without distillation. This framework ensures every devotional contains shareable units that work in isolation AND point back to the full experience.

**Core Tension:** Create content that stands alone on social platforms while maintaining the integrity and context of deeper theological teaching.

**Goal:** Users encounter EUONGELION first through a shareable moment, then discover the fuller devotional experience.

---

## 1. Shareable Content Units

### From Every Devotional, Extract:

#### A. Pull Quotes

**What:** Single sentences that capture the "aha moment" of a teaching section.

**Characteristics:**

- 15-25 words maximum
- Complete thought that doesn't require context
- Emotionally resonant or intellectually provocative
- Avoids insider language (no "quiet time," "backslider," etc.)
- Works for believers AND seekers

**Example Extractions:**

- "Busyness is the modern form of idolatry. When your schedule rules your heart, you've crowned the wrong king."
- "Doubt isn't the opposite of faith. Apathy is."
- "Sabbath isn't about what you stop doing--it's about Who you start trusting."

**From Module Types:** Teaching, Insight, Bridge, Takeaway

#### B. Scripture Cards

**What:** Bible verses formatted for visual sharing.

**Characteristics:**

**CTA Style:**

- "Explore" not "Click here"

## 4. Content Extraction System

### How Devotionals Get Tagged for Shareability

Every devotional module should include metadata that identifies shareable content during the writing process.

---

### Tagging Methodology

**During Content Creation:**
Writers annotate shareable elements as they write, not after. This ensures shareability is baked in, not bolted on.

**Tag Format:**

```
[shareable: type]
Content here
[/shareable]
```

**Example in Teaching Module:**

```markdown
The Hebrew word is הֶבֶל (hevel). It means vapor, breath--something
you can't hold onto.

[shareable: insight]
Solomon used this word 38 times in Ecclesiastes. He looked at
everything he'd achieved--palaces, wealth, wisdom--and called
it all "vapor." Not meaningless. Just... temporary.
[/shareable]

This changes how we read the book...
```

---

### JSON Structure for Shareable Elements

Extend existing module structure with shareable metadata:

```json
{
  "type": "teaching",
  "data": {
    "content": "Full teaching content here...",
    "pardes_layer": "derash"
  },
  "shareable": [
    {
      "id": "teaching-001-insight",
      "type": "insight",
      "content": "Solomon used 'hevel' 38 times. He looked at everything he'd achieved and called it all 'vapor.' Not meaningless. Just temporary.",
      "platforms": ["instagram", "twitter", "facebook"],
      "formats": ["square_card", "text_tweet"],
      "tone": "intellectual",
      "audience_fit": ["skeptical_seeker", "stuck_believer"],
      "visual_treatment": "dark"
    },
    {
      "id": "teaching-001-quote",
      "type": "pull_quote",
      "content": "Not meaningless. Just temporary.",
      "attribution": null,
      "platforms": ["instagram", "pinterest"],
      "formats": ["square_card", "vertical_pin"],
      "tone": "reflective",
      "audience_fit": ["all"],
      "visual_treatment": "light"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Shareable Element Schema

```json
{
  "shareable": {
    "id": "string (unique identifier)",
    "type": "enum (pull_quote, scripture, word_card, breath_prayer, question, insight, story_excerpt)",
    "content": "string (the shareable text)",
    "scripture_reference": "string (optional, if applicable)",
    "hebrew_greek": {
      "original": "string (Hebrew/Greek characters)",
      "transliteration": "string",
      "pronunciation": "string",
      "definition": "string (3-5 words)"
    },
    "attribution": "string (optional, for quotes)",
    "platforms": ["array of platform identifiers"],
    "formats": ["array of format types"],
    "tone": "enum (intellectual, emotional, provocative, peaceful, challenging)",
    "audience_fit": ["array of audience types or 'all'"],
    "visual_treatment": "enum (light, dark, themed)",
    "theme_color": "string (optional, if using rare color)",
    "series_slug": "string (parent series)",
    "day_number": "integer (parent day)",
    "source_module_type": "string (original module type)",
    "created_date": "ISO date",
    "evergreen": "boolean (true if not time-sensitive)"
  }
}
```

---

### Extraction Workflow

1. **During Writing:**
   - Writer tags shareable content inline
   - Writer suggests platforms, formats, tone

2. **During Review:**
   - Editor validates shareable elements work standalone
   - Editor confirms no context is lost
   - Editor adjusts audience fit and platforms

3. **During Publishing:**
   - System extracts shareable elements into separate database
   - System generates platform-specific versions
   - System queues for scheduling tool

4. **Ongoing:**
   - Analytics track performance by shareable element
   - High performers get re-surfaced
   - Low performers get revised or retired

---

## 5. User Sharing Flow

### How Users Share From Within the App

Sharing should feel natural, not forced. The goal is to make it easy for users to share what moved them.

---

### Sharing Touchpoints

**1. End of Day:**
After completing a day's reading, users see:

```
Done for today.

[Share something from today's reading]
[Continue to tomorrow]
```

---

**2. Mid-Content Highlights:**
Users can tap-and-hold on:

- Pull quotes
- Scripture passages
- Insights
- Breath prayers

This reveals a "Share" option that opens sharing modal.

---

**3. End of Series:**
After completing full series:

```
You finished [Series Name].

Know someone who needs this?
[Share This Series]

What's next?
[Find Another Series]
```

---

### Pre-Generated vs. Custom Sharing

**Pre-Generated (Recommended):**
When user selects "Share," system offers pre-designed cards:

```
Share this moment:

[Pre-generated card preview 1]
[Pre-generated card preview 2]
[Pre-generated card preview 3]

Or share as text only
```

**Benefits:**

- Brand consistency maintained
- Optimized for each platform
- Higher quality = higher share rate
- Attribution built in

---

**Custom Sharing:**
User can also:

- Copy text to clipboard
- Share link directly
- Add personal message to pre-generated card

```
Add your own words:
[Text input field]
[Share with your message]
```

---

### Platform-Specific Sharing

**Native Share Sheet:**

- Use device's native share functionality
- Pre-populate with appropriate content
- Include tracking link (see Attribution section)

**Direct-to-Platform:**

- Instagram: Open in Instagram app with image ready
- Twitter: Pre-populate tweet text + image attachment
- Facebook: Use share API with Open Graph
- Pinterest: Pin image with pre-filled description
- Copy link: Generate shareable link with UTM params

---

### Attribution and Tracking

**Every Shared Link Includes:**

```
euongelion.com/series/[slug]?
  utm_source=[platform]
  &utm_medium=share
  &utm_content=[shareable_id]
  &ref=[user_anonymous_id]
```

**Tracking Without Privacy Invasion:**

- No personally identifiable information
- Anonymous user ID only (if user opted in)
- Focus on content performance, not user surveillance
- Clear privacy policy around sharing analytics

**Attribution Goals:**

- Know which content gets shared most
- Know which platforms drive traffic
- Know which series have viral potential
- Attribute conversions (start series after share click)

---

## 6. Brand Voice on Social

### Tone Differences: Social vs. Long-Form

The devotional voice is contemplative, deep, unhurried. Social voice maintains brand identity but adapts for the medium.

---

### Voice Spectrum

| Context              | Tone                               | Example                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Devotional Body**  | Contemplative, pastoral, unhurried | "Sit with this for a moment. Let it work in you before you move on."      |

### Social Voice Guidelines

**DO:**

- Write like a thoughtful friend, not a brand
- Be warm but not saccharine
- Ask genuine questions
- Acknowledge tension and doubt
- Use "we" not "EUONGELION says"
- Let content speak without over-explaining

**DON'T:**

- Use exclamation points excessively
- Sound desperate for engagement
- Preach or lecture
- Use insider Christian language
- Respond defensively to criticism
- Over-promise transformation

---

### Caption Formulas

**For Pull Quotes:**

```
[Brief context or setup]
[Quote text]
[Invitation or question]
```

Example:

```
Solomon achieved everything. His verdict?
"Meaningless. Meaningless. Everything is meaningless."
But he wasn't done. He found something that lasts.
Link in bio to explore the full series.
```

**For Scripture Cards:**

```
[Personal observation or question]
[Scripture reference]
[Invitation]
```

Example:

```
What if rest isn't laziness--it's trust?
Matthew 11:28
We're spending 5 days with this passage. Start today.
```

**For Word Cards:**

```
[The word and basic meaning]
[Interesting fact or connection]
[Why it matters]
```

Example:

```
Hevel. Hebrew for "vapor" or "breath."
Solomon used it 38 times in one book.
Understanding this word changes everything about Ecclesiastes.
```

### Hashtag Strategy

**Platform-Specific Approach:**

| Platform  | Hashtag Volume | Types                                                 |
| --------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Instagram | 5-10 per post  | Mix of broad (#faith) and specific (#hebrewwordstudy) |
| Twitter/X | 1-3 per post   | Only highly relevant, never stuffed                   |
| TikTok    | 3-5 per post   | Trending + community (#ChristianTikTok)               |
| Facebook  | 0-2 per post   | Minimal, organic reach priority                       |
| Pinterest | 5-10 per pin   | Keyword-rich, SEO-focused                             |
| LinkedIn  | 0-3 per post   | Professional, topical                                 |

**Core Hashtag Categories:**

1. **Brand:** #EUONGELION (use sparingly, build recognition)

2. **Format:** #DailyDevotional, #ScriptureCard, #HebrewWordStudy

3. **Theme:** Based on series topic
   - Rest: #Sabbath, #RestInGod, #Margin
   - Doubt: #Faith, #HonestFaith, #Doubt
   - Identity: #WhoAmI, #IdentityInChrist

4. **Audience:**
   - #ChristianWomen, #ChristianMen (gender-specific content only)
   - #ChristianLeaders (Shepherd content)
   - #Deconstruction (reaching questioning believers)

5. **Community:**
   - #ChristianTikTok
   - #FaithCommunity
   - #JesusFollowers

**Avoid:**

- #Blessed (overused, signals inauthenticity)
- #ChristianInfluencer (performative)
- #GodsNotDead (culture war adjacent)
- Any hashtag that signals "insider" vs. "outsider"

---

### Engagement Approach

**Responding to Comments:**

| Type                     | Response Approach                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Positive                 | Genuine gratitude: "Thank you. Glad this resonated."                                                 |
| Question                 | Thoughtful answer or point to resource: "Great question. We explore this in Day 3 of the series."    |
| Disagreement             | Gracious acknowledgment: "I hear you. This is a tension Scripture holds too."                        |
| Trolling                 | Ignore or minimal response. Never defensive.                                                         |
| Personal struggle shared | Private message if appropriate: "Thank you for sharing this. Would you like to talk more privately?" |

**Community Building:**

- Repost user-generated content (with permission)
- Celebrate when users share their insights
- Create conversation, not broadcast
- Ask genuine questions in captions
- Respond to comments within 24 hours

## 7. Viral Potential Analysis

### What Types of Content Spread

Not all content is equally shareable. This section identifies patterns that increase viral potential while maintaining theological integrity.

---

### High-Share Content Characteristics

**1. Emotional Resonance**
Content that makes people feel seen, understood, or hopeful.

| Emotion     | Example                                               | Platform Fit        |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Relief      | "It's okay to have doubts. You're not alone."         | Instagram, Facebook |
| Wonder      | "The Hebrew word for this is also the word for that." | Twitter, TikTok     |
| Conviction  | "What if your busyness is actually avoidance?"        | Twitter, LinkedIn   |
| Hope        | "It's never too late to come home."                   | All platforms       |
| Recognition | "When you realize the sermon was about you."          | Instagram, TikTok   |

---

**2. Intellectual Surprise**
Content that reveals something unexpected about familiar texts.

| Type                  | Example                                                                           | Platform Fit         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Hidden Connection     | "Mount Moriah (Abraham's sacrifice) is the same hill as Calvary."                 | Twitter, TikTok      |
| Word Study Revelation | "The Hebrew word for 'rest' and 'marriage' share the same root."                  | Instagram, Pinterest |
| Historical Context    | "When Jesus said 'I am the bread of life,' He was standing in a bakery district." | Twitter, TikTok      |
| Literary Structure    | "The Psalms are arranged to tell one story. Here's how."                          | Twitter threads      |

---

**3. Countercultural Provocation**
Content that challenges cultural assumptions without being offensive.

**Sweet Spot:** Challenge accepted wisdom in a way that intrigues rather than attacks.

| Provocative Angle   | Example                                                               | Risk Level |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Rest vs. Hustle     | "Sabbath isn't laziness. It's the most productive thing you can do."  | Low        |
| Doubt vs. Certainty | "Your doubts don't disqualify you. Your apathy does."                 | Low        |
| Success Redefined   | "Solomon had it all. He called it 'meaningless.'"                     | Low        |
| Suffering           | "God doesn't waste pain. But He doesn't cause it for lessons either." | Medium     |
| Politics            | AVOID entirely                                                        | N/A        |

---

**4. Visual Distinctiveness**
Content that stops the scroll through aesthetic excellence.

**Visual Patterns That Spread:**

- High contrast (gold on black)
- Negative space (unusual in social feeds)
- Hebrew characters (visually distinctive)
- Photography with single focal point
- Minimal text, maximum impact

---

### Controversy Without Compromise

**The Goal:** Spark conversation, not division. Challenge assumptions, not people.

**Acceptable Provocation:**

- Challenging cultural idols (busyness, success, self-sufficiency)
- Presenting uncomfortable Scripture honestly
- Questioning comfortable Christianity
- Naming real struggles (doubt, anger at God, spiritual dryness)

**Off-Limits:**

- Political commentary (even "both sides" framing)
- Criticism of other denominations or traditions
- Hot-button social issues without pastoral care
- Anything that punches down

**When Controversy Arises:**

1. Don't delete unless truly harmful
2. Respond with grace, not defense
3. Acknowledge complexity
4. Point to full context when taken out of context
5. Know when to disengage

---

### Viral Mechanics by Platform

| Platform  | What Spreads                      | Algorithm Priority               |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |

| Day | Instagram      | Twitter | Facebook     | TikTok      |
| --- | -------------- | ------- | ------------ | ----------- |

---

### Evergreen vs. Timely Content

**Evergreen (80% of content):**

- Scripture cards
- Word studies
- Pull quotes from completed series
- Reflection questions
- Breath prayers

**Characteristics:**

- Can be scheduled weeks in advance
- Can be reshared quarterly
- Not tied to current events
- Forms content library for ongoing use

---

**Timely (20% of content):**

- New series launches
- Seasonal content (Advent, Lent, Easter)
- Cultural moment responses (rare, careful)
- Community highlights

**Characteristics:**

- Requires real-time creation
- Short shelf life
- Higher engagement potential
- Higher risk if mishandled

---

### Seasonal Content Planning

| Season           | Theme Focus                      | Content Adjustment                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Advent (Dec)     | Hope, waiting, anticipation      | Christmas-adjacent series promotion        |
| Lent (Feb-Apr)   | Sacrifice, wilderness, surrender | Darker visual treatment, deeper content    |
| Easter (Apr)     | Resurrection, new life           | Light visual treatment, hope-focused       |
| Summer (Jun-Aug) | Rest, sabbath, margin            | Lighter posting cadence, vacation-friendly |
| Fall (Sep-Nov)   | New beginnings, discipline       | Series launches, fresh start messaging     |

---

## 9. Integration with Devotional Structure

### Writing Devotionals with Shareability in Mind

Shareability should be baked in during writing, not extracted after.

---

### The Dual-Purpose Writing Principle

Every key sentence should:

1. Work in context (within the devotional)
2. Work standalone (shared without context)

**Example:**

**In Context:** "The Hebrew word here is 'hevel.' It means vapor, breath--something you can't hold onto. Solomon used it 38 times. Everything he achieved? Vapor."

**Standalone Version:** "Solomon used the Hebrew word 'hevel' 38 times in Ecclesiastes. Everything he achieved--wealth, power, wisdom--he called it 'vapor.' Something you can't hold onto."

**The Writing Process:**

1. Write for context first (devotional integrity)
2. Identify shareable moments
3. Adjust phrasing so it works both ways
4. Tag for extraction

---

### Module Annotations for Shareability

**In the writing template, add shareability prompts:**

```markdown
## Teaching Section

[Main teaching content here...]

### SHAREABLE MOMENT CHECK

- [ ] Is there a pull quote that works standalone? Tag it.
- [ ] Is there an insight that would surprise someone? Tag it.
- [ ] Does any sentence make you want to share it? Tag it.
```

---

### Writing Guidelines by Module Type

**Scripture Module:**

- Choose a translation that's readable standalone
- If verse is long, identify the shareable portion
- Note which phrases should be visually emphasized

**Teaching Module:**

- Write one "quotable" sentence per major section
- Open paragraphs with strong statements
- Close sections with memorable summaries

**Vocab Module:**

- Every vocab module is inherently shareable
- Definition should be 3-5 words
- Include one "did you know" fact

**Insight Module:**

- This IS the shareable unit
- Maximum 25 words
- Should provoke "I never thought of it that way"

**Reflection Module:**

- Questions should work standalone
- Avoid compound questions
- One powerful question > three weak ones

**Prayer Module:**

- Include one breath prayer extract
- Short phrases that work as meditation

**Story Module:**

- Hook should work standalone
- End with unresolved tension (drives clicks)
- Bridge to spiritual truth should be implicit in excerpt

---

### Shareable Unit Requirements by Series

**Every 5-Day Series Should Produce:**

| Unit Type            | Minimum | Quality Bar                                   |
| -------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Pull Quotes          | 5       | At least 2 should be "share on sight" quality |
| Scripture Cards      | 3       | Primary verses with visual emphasis           |
| Word Cards           | 1-2     | Hebrew/Greek with clear meaning               |
| Breath Prayers       | 1-2     | Memorable, repeatable                         |
| Reflection Questions | 5       | One per day, shareable standalone             |
| Insights             | 3-5     | "I never thought of that" quality             |
| Story Excerpts       | 1-2     | Hook + curiosity gap                          |

**Total: 20-25 shareable units per series**

---

## 10. Metrics to Track

### What Success Looks Like

Social success for EUONGELION isn't vanity metrics. It's building a path from social encounter to devotional engagement.
