# EUONGELION Visual Direction

> **Status:** ACTIVE - Founder-directed
> **Date:** January 17, 2026
> **Approach:** Art direction over templates

---

## Core Visual Philosophy

This is **editorial design**, not a templated system. Think magazine art direction - each piece considered individually while maintaining brand cohesion through consistent elements, not identical layouts.

---

## 1. IMAGE STYLE

**Direction:** Hybrid - Photography + Illustration + Dithered Treatment

- Combine photographic elements with illustrative elements
- Apply dithered/halftone effects as a unifying texture
- Not purely one style - intentional mixing
- **Founder creating samples** to establish the exact treatment

**Reference searches needed:**

- Dithered photography examples
- Mixed media editorial design
- Halftone texture overlays
- Risograph aesthetic applied to digital

---

## 2. VISUAL MOOD

**Direction:** Juxtaposition - Contemplative AND Bold/Dramatic

| Context                 | Mood                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Reflective content      | Contemplative, quiet, soft |
| Proclamation / doctrine | Bold, dramatic, striking   |
| Narrative / story       | Dynamic, tension           |
| Sabbath / rest          | Minimal, spacious          |

**Not one mood - the content dictates the approach.**

---

## 3. COLOR TREATMENT

**Direction:** Limited Color Palettes

- Each piece uses a **restricted palette** (2-4 colors max)
- Colors should feel focused and intentional
- Consistency through restraint, not through sameness
- Brand colors (Tehom, Scroll, Gold) as anchors, not restrictions

**Potential approaches:**

- Duotone treatments
- Monotone with single accent
- Brand palette variations
- Seasonal/series-specific palettes

---

## 4. PEOPLE IN IMAGERY

**Direction:** Yes, but anonymous and contextual

| Context                    | Approach                                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Modern/contemporary        | Anonymous - silhouettes, partial figures, turned away |
| Biblical narrative         | Can be more identifiable - the story needs faces      |
| Universal human experience | Hands, posture, gesture - suggest without identifying |

**Rationale:** The Bible is about God and people. We need people. But modern figures should feel universal, not specific individuals.

---

## 5. TYPOGRAPHY ON IMAGES

**Direction:** Magazine-style editorial - variety over system

- Treat each piece as a **design opportunity**
- Type can be integrated, overlaid, or separate based on what the image needs
- Less rigid system, more art direction
- Reference: Editorial magazine spreads, not social media templates

**Approaches to use:**

- Large display type on bold images
- Subtle title treatments on contemplative images
- Scripture integrated into composition
- Full-bleed images with type in margins
- Type AS the image (typographic illustrations)

---

## 6. IMAGE SOURCING

**Direction:** Primarily AI-generated based on prescribed styles

**Workflow:**

1. Define style guides / prompts for each visual mode
2. Generate using Midjourney / DALL-E / Stable Diffusion
3. Apply dithered/textured post-processing
4. Founder review and curation

**Benefits:**

- Consistent style control
- Unlimited iteration
- No licensing issues
- Custom to content needs

---

## Next Steps

1. **Founder creates sample images** establishing the dithered photo/illustration hybrid
2. Document the exact treatment (filters, effects, process)
3. Create prompt templates for AI generation
4. Build a reference library of approved examples
5. Define the 3-4 "modes" that cover different content types

---

## Reference Collection Needed

To fully develop this direction, gather examples from:

- **Pinterest:** Dithered design, risograph aesthetic, editorial magazine layouts
- **Dribbble:** Mixed media illustration, limited palette design
- **Midjourney Explore:** Styles that match the vision
- **Magazines:** Kinfolk, Cereal, The Gentlewoman (editorial restraint)
- **Album art:** Indie/alternative covers with texture and restraint
