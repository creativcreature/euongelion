It covers income, expenses, spending habits, debt usage, savings, and current balances, along with expectations and plans moving forward.

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Total Income:
\f1\b0  Approximately 
\f0\b $15,656
\f1\b0  of net income was received in Q4 2025. The primary source was your paycheck from Melt LLC, which accounted for about 
\f0\b $14,980
\f1\b0  of that total (about 95% of income). You receive a biweekly paycheck with a net pay around 
\f0\b $2,346
\f1\b0  each (after taxes and deductions). Notably, each paycheck is split roughly 50/50 between two accounts: about 
\f0\b $1,173
\f1\b0  goes into your Capital One checking (\'853911) and 
\f0\b $1,173
\f1\b0  into your MoneyLion/Metabank account (\'853008).\

For example, you received Cash App payments totaling $140 from a relative in October. These infusions helped cover short-term needs but were relatively minor compared to paycheck income.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 \strokec2 Overall, about 
\f0\b \strokec2 $4,800
\f1\b0 \strokec2  was spent on living expenses and bills during Q4 (roughly 31% of income). However, a much larger amount \'96 approximately

\f1\b0 \strokec2  \'96 went toward 
\f0\b \strokec2 debt repayments and short-term loan advances
\f1\b0 \strokec2 , which consumed over half of your income for the quarter. The remainder of income went toward savings transfers (which were later mostly reversed) or carried into the new year.\

\f1\b0  
\f2\i Rent
\f1\i0  \'96 It appears you did not have any rent payments in the last 3 months (no transactions labeled as rent). If housing is provided or paid by someone else, this has kept a major expense off your budget. This is a significant advantage, as no rent expense frees up income for other needs (or savings).\

\f1\b0  You paid about 
\f0\b $432
\f1\b0  for utilities over Q4. This includes 
\f0\b natural gas
\f1\b0  bills to Gas South (~$302 for two months) and an additional 
\f0\b $130
\f1\b0  payment via 
\f2\i Paymentus
\f1\i0  (likely an electric or utility setup payment). There were no Georgia Power electric bill charges recorded, so possibly electricity wasn\'92t billed in this period or was covered elsewhere. Gas bills averaged roughly $150/month in the winter, which may decrease in spring.\

\f1\b0  Essential telecom services cost about

\f0\b $184/month for AT&T
\f1\b0  (cell phone) and 
\f0\b $110/month for Xfinity
\f1\b0  (internet/cable). These are relatively high recurring bills. The AT&T bill suggests multiple lines or phone financing, and the Comcast/Xfinity internet service is a typical cost. Combined, these utilities are about ~$294 per month.\

\f1\b0  payments did not explicitly appear \'96 possibly you have a policy that wasn\'92t billed in this period or it\'92s paid in a lump sum. (There were no transactions for the expected insurer name, so this may need review to ensure auto coverage is accounted for).

\f1\b0  Grocery spending totaled approximately

\f1\b0  for Oct\'96Dec, averaging ~$365 per month. This was spread across 
\f0\b 32+ trips
\f1\b0  mainly to Publix and Kroger. Notably, there were 
\f0\b 25 small transactions at Publix
\f1\b0  (totalling ~$533) and 
\f0\b 7 at Kroger
\f1\b0  (totalling ~$518). This suggests frequent grocery runs, often smaller purchases. The high number of Publix visits (multiple times per week) might indicate buying in small quantities or picking up prepared foods.

\f1\i0  ($25.74) and a Starbucks stop ($7.21) were noted. These outings, while not very expensive individually, were fairly frequent (on average one dining purchase every 3 days).

\f1\b0  The reliance on short-term loans has been a major strain on your finances. Over half of your net income in the last 3 months was spent just on repaying advances (plus their fees). This creates a cycle where each paycheck is heavily committed to past borrowing. It also incurs extra costs (tips, fees, or memberships). Breaking out of this cycle is critical to improving cash flow. Every dollar not paid in loan fees is a dollar that could go to savings or true expenses. We will address this in the outlook.\

\f1\b0  After the current MoneyLion advance is repaid, strive not to take any new advances from SoLo, MoneyLion, Brigit, etc. This will be challenging if cash runs short, but remember that every $1 borrowed might cost ~$1.05 or more to repay, and it traps a portion of your next paycheck. Instead, use your existing savings if an emergency arises, or consider interest-free alternatives (perhaps an advance from work or help from family if absolutely needed).

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Utilize Income Surplus to Pay Expenses Directly:
\f1\b0  With ~$5k income per month and ~$1.5k essentials, you theoretically have around ~$3.5k left each month 
\f0\b before
\f1\b0  discretionary spending. In practice, much of that was going to loan repayments. By not taking loans, more of your paycheck remains available. Use that surplus in the month it\'92s earned to cover things that you previously covered with loans. For example, if mid-month you are low on cash, recall that another paycheck is coming within two weeks \'96 plan bills around paydays to avoid shortfalls. It may help to maintain a 
\f0\b two-week budget cycle
\f1\b0  aligned with paychecks, allocating funds to all bills and known expenses right when you get paid, so you aren\'92t caught off guard.\

\f0\b settle or accelerate payoff
\f1\b0  on one of them using some of the newfound cash flow (for instance, an extra $100 or $200 to clear the $90 Resurgent balance completely). Eliminating a payment not only reduces future expenses but also improves your credit situation.\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Emergency Fund:
\f1\b0  Resist the urge to dip into savings for non-emergencies. Ideally, with no new loan payments, you can build a buffer. Even if it\'92s just keeping the $350 intact and adding to it, that fund will help avoid future borrowing. Consider setting aside a small portion of each paycheck (even $50 each pay, which is ~$100 a month) to slowly build your emergency fund. Automating this right when you get paid could ensure it happens. By March, you could grow savings by a few hundred dollars, which further insulates you from needing high-interest loans.\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Monitoring and Adjusting:
\f1\b0  Continue tracking your transactions closely (as you have been with your financial workbook). Use your new 
\f0\b Claude Max
\f1\b0  AI assistant to help analyze spending patterns each month. For example, after January, review how well you stuck to the budget and where the pain points were. If groceries or dining exceeded plan, Claude could help brainstorm meal plans or low-cost recipes. If a surprise expense came up, adjust February\'92s plan to compensate. Regular check-ins will keep you on track.\

\f0\b\fs36 \cf0 Conclusion\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 \strokec2 In summary, the last 3 months showed 
\f0\b \strokec2 stable income but significant financial strain due to heavy use of short-term loans and advances
\f1\b0 \strokec2 , which consumed more than half of your income in fees and repayments. Essential living expenses (utilities, phone, groceries, etc.) were covered, but little progress was made in saving due to the debt cycle and discretionary spending.\
Going into the next 3 months, the focus should be on 
\f0\b \strokec2 breaking the debt cycle
\f1\b0 \strokec2  by avoiding new high-cost loans, sticking to a realistic budget for essentials and discretionary items, and gradually building savings. With an expected net income of around $5k per month, there is ample room to meet all expenses 
\f2\i \strokec2 and
\f1\i0 \strokec2  improve your financial cushion \'96 
\f0\b \strokec2 if expensive debt can be minimized
\f1\b0 \strokec2 . By cutting unnecessary spending and using each paycheck wisely, you can start having money left over each month. This surplus can go towards an emergency fund and modest investments (like the planned $25/month ETF), setting you up for a more secure future.\
Finally, using the insights from this report and assistance from tools like Claude, you can develop healthier financial habits. This includes planning grocery trips and meals to reduce food costs, evaluating subscriptions, and setting aside funds for known upcoming bills (so you aren\'92t caught off guard). The next quarter can be a turning point where reliance on payday advances is replaced with true budgeting and saving. Stick to the plan outlined, and by March 2026 you should see debts shrinking, savings growing, and stress reducing \'96 a significant step toward financial stability. Good luck, and keep monitoring your progress closely!\
