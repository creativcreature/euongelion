## Brand Voice Reminder

Before writing any email, remember:

- **Warm, not casual.** Like a letter, not a text message.
- **Confident, not arrogant.** We know what we believe, but remain curious.
- **Dense, not verbose.** Every word earns its place.
- **Reverent, not stuffy.** Awe without pretension.
- **Never desperate or salesy.** We're a wise mentor, not a brand.

Avoid: exclamation points, urgency language, guilt, gamification, casual greetings like "Hey!" or "What's up!"

## 2. Welcome Sequence

_5 emails over the first week, introducing users to the experience_

---

### 2.1 Welcome Email (Day 0)

_Sent immediately upon account creation_

**Subject Line Options:**

1. Welcome to EUONGELION
2. You're here.
3. The door is open

**Preview Text:** Ancient depth, modern clarity. Your journey begins now.

**Body:**

```
EUONGELION

Welcome.

You've just joined a community of people who believe the Bible is worth reading slowly. Not skimming. Not speed-reading. Actually dwelling in it.

EUONGELION is a daily devotional unlike anything else. We go deep into Hebrew and Greek words. We tell stories that make you stop. We take the ancient text seriously—and we take you seriously.

Here's what happens next:

1. **Your first series is ready.** Based on your Soul Audit, we've matched you with a series designed for where you are right now.

2. **One day at a time.** New content unlocks each morning at 7 AM your time. There's no rushing ahead. This is intentional.

3. **Take your time.** Each day takes 15-20 minutes to read properly. If you only get halfway, that's fine. The goal isn't completion—it's encounter.

[Begin Your First Day]

You're not behind. You're here. That's enough.

Grace and peace,
EUONGELION

### 2.2 Day 2: How This Works

_Sent morning of Day 2_

**Subject Line Options:**

1. How this actually works
2. What to expect each day
3. The rhythm of this place

**Preview Text:** A few things that might help as you settle in.

**Body:**

```
EUONGELION

Day 2.

Now that you've had a day to explore, here are a few things that might help:

**The Structure**

Every devotional follows a pattern:
- We start with a Hebrew or Greek word study
- We tell a story that illuminates the text
- We explore the Scripture through multiple layers
- We end with a practice: a breath prayer, a reflection question, something to carry with you

**The Pacing**

This isn't designed to be fast. We've deliberately created content that asks you to slow down. Some days, you might not finish. That's okay. Come back to it, or let it go and move forward. Either way.

**The Languages**

You'll encounter Hebrew and Greek throughout. Don't worry—you don't need to know them. We translate everything. But there's something powerful about seeing the original words. Meanings emerge that English can't carry.

**The Footnotes**

Every devotional includes citations and footnotes. This is theology grounded in scholarship. You can trust the sources.

### 2.3 Day 4: What to Expect This Week

_Sent morning of Day 4_

**Subject Line Options:**

1. What's ahead this week
2. The week is taking shape
3. Day 4: You're finding the rhythm

**Preview Text:** A brief word about what's unfolding.

**Body:**

```
EUONGELION

Day 4.

You're nearly halfway through your first week. By now, you may have noticed a few things:

This isn't quick.

It asks something of you.

It rewards attention.

**What's unfolding**

Your current series is building toward something. Each day connects to the next. The Hebrew words we're studying will reappear. The themes will deepen. By the end of the series, you'll see things you couldn't see on Day 1.

**A note about difficulty**

Some days will be harder than others. The content isn't always comforting. We believe you can handle weight. We believe complexity is a gift. If a day challenges you, that's not a mistake.

**The Sabbath is coming**

In a few days, you'll encounter something different. We observe a rhythm of rest. More on that soon.

[Continue to Day 4]

### 2.4 Day 6: Your First Sabbath Approaching

_Sent morning of Day 6_

**Subject Line Options:**

1. Tomorrow is different
2. The Sabbath gift
3. A day of rest is coming

**Preview Text:** We observe a rhythm of rest. Tomorrow, so will you.

**Body:**

```
EUONGELION

Day 6.

Tomorrow is the Sabbath.

In the rhythm of EUONGELION, one day each week is set apart. There's no new content on the Sabbath. No push to consume. No emails nudging you forward.

This isn't a bug. It's a feature.

**Why rest?**

The Hebrew word *shabbat* means to cease—to stop striving. God rested on the seventh day, not because He was tired, but because He was finished. The work was complete.

We've built this rest into EUONGELION because we believe spiritual formation includes non-doing. Not everything is meant to be accomplished.

**Tomorrow**

You won't receive a new devotional or an email from us. Use the day however you'd like. Return to something from this week. Sit in silence. Or simply be.

We'll resume together on Day 8.

[Finish Day 6]

Grace and peace,
EUONGELION

### 2.5 Day 7: Rest Day Reminder

_Sent morning of Day 7 (Sabbath)_

**Subject Line Options:**

1. Today is rest
2. Sabbath
3. Nothing to do today

**Preview Text:** No new content today. By design.

**Body:**

```
EUONGELION

Sabbath.

There's nothing new for you today. That's intentional.

The Hebrew word for this kind of rest is *menucha*—not just the absence of work, but the presence of peace. A dwelling place. A settled soul.

You might:
- Return to a moment from this week that stayed with you
- Sit with a verse without commentary
- Practice one of the breath prayers
- Simply rest

We'll see you tomorrow with Day 8.

Grace and peace,
EUONGELION

This kind of sustained attention is rare. In a world of fragments, you chose to stay with something long enough to let it shape you. That's not nothing.

Take a moment to notice:

- What word or phrase has stayed with you?
- What shifted in your understanding?
- What question emerged that wasn't there before?

**What's next**

When you're ready, your next series is waiting. There's no rush. Let this one settle before moving on.

### 3.4 Milestone: 7 Days

_Sent after 7 consecutive days of engagement_

**Subject Line Options:**

1. One week
2. 7 days
3. You're here. Day 7.

**Preview Text:** A week of showing up.

**Body:**

```
EUONGELION

Seven days.

You've shown up for a full week. That's a rhythm beginning to form.

We don't believe in streaks or badges. We're not going to give you points. But we do believe that habits of attention shape who we become. And you've just laid seven stones.

Keep going. Or rest. Both are good.

Grace and peace,
EUONGELION

**CTA Button Text:** None (Acknowledgment, not action)

### 3.5 Milestone: 30 Days

_Sent after 30 days of engagement_

**Subject Line Options:**

1. A month
2. Day 30
3. Thirty days of depth

**Preview Text:** Something is forming.

**Body:**

```
EUONGELION

Thirty days.

A month ago, you started. You've returned again and again. Whatever brought you here—curiosity, hunger, habit—you've stayed.

The Psalms speak of a path:

*"Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked... but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on it day and night."*

Day and night. Not perfectly—but persistently.

You're becoming someone who gives attention to ancient words. That changes a person. Slowly. Quietly. But it changes them.

Grace and peace,
EUONGELION

### 3.6 Milestone: 100 Days

_Sent after 100 days of engagement_

**Subject Line Options:**

1. Day 100
2. One hundred days
3. You've been here 100 days

**Preview Text:** This is no longer new. It's who you are.

**Body:**

```
EUONGELION

One hundred days.

This is no longer an experiment. It's a practice. A discipline. Part of who you are now.

The Hebrew word *chazon* means vision—not in the mystical sense, but in the sense of seeing clearly. Of having eyes trained to perceive what others miss.

A hundred days of word studies, of stories, of sitting with Scripture—that trains the eyes. You see differently now than you did on Day 1. You may not notice it. But it's true.

Thank you for being here. For staying. For trusting this process.

Grace and peace,
EUONGELION

No restart. No penalty. Just an open door.

You're always welcome.
