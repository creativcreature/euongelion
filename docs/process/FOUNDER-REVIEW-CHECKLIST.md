| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| [ ]   | **Orthodox teaching** - Aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy (Nicene, Chalcedonian) |      |

## Review Efficiency Tips

### For Faster Reviews

1. **Read the opening first** - If hook doesn't work, stop and note
2. **Scan for red flags** - Cliches, length issues, missing elements
3. **Check interactive elements early** - Often reveals overall quality
4. **Trust your gut** - If something feels off, it probably is
5. **Batch similar series** - Review same series in one sitting

### For Higher Quality

1. **Take breaks** - Review fatigue reduces quality
2. **Read aloud** - Catches awkward phrasing
3. **Imagine the audience** - Picture skeptic reading this
4. **Sleep on rejections** - Major decisions deserve reflection
5. **Document patterns** - Track common issues to prevent upstream

## Common Revision Requests

### Quick Copy-Paste Notes

**Voice too formal:**

> "This reads too academic. Simplify the language while keeping the depth. Imagine explaining this to a smart friend, not writing a seminary paper."

**Missing Christ connection:**

> "The Christ connection feels tacked on. Weave Jesus more organically through the devotional, especially in the Sod layer."

**Weak reflection questions:**

> "Questions are too surface-level. Push deeper. What would make someone stop and actually think?"

**Story doesn't connect:**

> "Great story, but the connection to the main theme isn't clear. Either strengthen the bridge or find a better illustration."

**Too long:**

> "This is running long. The section on [X] could be trimmed by 30% without losing substance."

**Citations missing:**

> "Several claims need citations. Specifically: [list]. Please add sources."
