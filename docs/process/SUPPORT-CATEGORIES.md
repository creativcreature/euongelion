## Category 1: Authentication Issues

### 1.1 Can't Log In - Magic Link Not Received

**Example Tickets:**

- "I never got my login email"
- "The magic link isn't arriving"
- "I've been waiting 20 minutes for my email"

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Check promotions tab (Gmail)
3. Verify email address spelled correctly
4. Check email provider isn't blocking
5. Try requesting a new link

**Response Template:**

```
Subject: Re: Login Help - Let's Get You In

Hi [Name],

Sorry you're having trouble getting in! Let's fix that.

First, a few quick checks:

1. **Check your spam/junk folder** - magic links sometimes land there
2. **Gmail users:** Check your "Promotions" tab
3. **Double-check the email:** Did you enter [email they provided]? Even a small typo can cause issues

If you've done all that and still nothing:

4. **Request a new link** - Sometimes the first one gets delayed. Try clicking "Send Magic Link" again
5. **Try a different email** - If you have another email, that can help us determine if it's provider-specific

If none of that works, reply with:
- The email you're trying to use
- What email provider it is (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.)
- What time you requested the link

I'll dig into our logs and get you sorted.

Grace and peace,
[Your name]
EUONGELION Support

### 1.2 Magic Link Expired

**Example Tickets:**

- "The link says it's expired"
- "I clicked the link but it didn't work"

**Response Template:**

```
Subject: Re: Expired Link - Easy Fix

Hi [Name],

Magic links expire after 15 minutes for security reasons - sounds like yours timed out before you clicked it.

Here's the quick fix:

1. Go back to wokegod.world
2. Enter your email again
3. Click "Send Magic Link"
4. Check your email and click the link **right away**

Pro tip: The link only works once. If you click it, then try to click it again later, it won't work. Just request a fresh one if needed.

Let me know if you hit any other snags!

Grace and peace,
[Your name]
EUONGELION Support

### 1.3 Multiple Device Login Issues

**Example Tickets:**

- "I was logged in on my phone but now I'm not"
- "Do I need to log in separately on each device?"

**Response Template:**

```
Subject: Re: Multi-Device Access

Hi [Name],

Good question! Here's how it works:

**Each device needs its own login** - When you sign in on your phone, that doesn't automatically sign you in on your laptop (and vice versa). You'll need to request a magic link on each device.

**But your progress syncs everywhere** - Once you're logged in, your completed days, series progress, and everything else is saved to your account. So whether you read on your phone at lunch or your laptop at night, your progress is always up to date.

To log in on a new device:
1. Go to wokegod.world
2. Enter your email
3. Click the magic link from that device

Hope that helps!

Grace and peace,
[Your name]
EUONGELION Support

## Category 2: Technical/Bug Reports

### 2.1 Page Won't Load

**Example Tickets:**

- "I keep getting an error when I try to open Day 3"
- "The page just spins and never loads"
- "I get a blank screen"

**Initial Response Template:**

```
Subject: Re: Loading Issue - Let's Troubleshoot

Hi [Name],

Frustrating when things don't load! Let's figure out what's happening.

First, a few things to try:

1. **Hard refresh** - Press Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
2. **Clear cache** - Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data > Cached images/files
3. **Try a different browser** - If you're on Chrome, try Safari or Firefox
4. **Check your connection** - Sometimes a weak signal causes partial loads

If it's still not working, I need a bit more info to help:

- What device are you using? (Phone, tablet, computer)
- What browser? (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- What page/devotional were you trying to load?
- Do you see any error message? (A screenshot would be super helpful)

With that info, I can dig deeper or escalate to our engineering team.

Grace and peace,
[Your name]

### 2.2 Feature Not Working

**Example Tickets:**

- "The share button doesn't do anything"
- "I can't save my journal entry"
- "The breath prayer won't start"

**Response Template:**

```
Subject: Re: [Feature] Issue - We're On It

Hi [Name],

Thanks for letting us know about this! I want to make sure we fix it.

To help our team track this down:

1. **What device/browser are you using?** (e.g., iPhone 14 / Safari)
2. **What exactly happens when you try to [action]?** (Nothing? Error message? Something else?)
3. **Has it ever worked for you, or is this the first time you've tried?**
4. **Can you share a screenshot or screen recording?** (Optional but super helpful)

In the meantime, here's a workaround if you need it:
[Provide specific workaround if one exists, e.g., "You can copy the text manually and paste it into your notes app"]

I'm flagging this for our engineering team and will follow up once we have more info.

### 2.3 Display/Formatting Issue

**Example Tickets:**

- "The Hebrew letters aren't showing up"
- "Everything looks weird on my phone"
- "The text is super tiny"

**Response Template:**

```
Subject: Re: Display Issue - Let's Fix It

Hi [Name],

Sorry the display isn't looking right! Different devices and browsers can sometimes render things differently.

Let's try a few things:

**If Hebrew/Greek isn't displaying:**
- Make sure your device's language/font settings support Unicode
- Try a different browser (Chrome usually has the best font support)
- Zoom in slightly (Cmd/Ctrl + Plus key)

**If layout looks broken:**
- Check if you're zoomed in/out on the page
- Try rotating your phone (portrait/landscape)
- Clear cache and refresh

**If text is too small/large:**
- Use your browser's zoom (Cmd/Ctrl + Plus/Minus)
- Check your device's accessibility settings

If none of that helps, please send me:
- A screenshot of what you're seeing
- Your device and browser info
- The specific page/devotional

I'll make sure our team sees this.

Grace and peace,
[Your name]

Subject: Re: Your Question About [Topic]

Hi [Name],

I love that you're digging into this! Questions like yours are exactly why we do what we do.

[Address their specific question thoughtfully - this will vary by content]

A few things to keep in mind:

Subject: Re: Account Deletion Request

Hi [Name],

I'm sorry to see you go, but I completely understand. Your privacy is important, and we'll handle this right away.

To confirm deletion, I need to verify:
- **Is this the email on your account?** [email they contacted from]
- **Do you want us to delete all data?** This includes your reading history, journal entries (if any), and account information. This cannot be undone.

Once you confirm, I'll process the deletion within 48 hours and send you confirmation when it's complete.

Before you go - if there's something we could have done better, I'd genuinely love to hear it. No pressure, but feedback helps us improve.

Whatever you decide, thank you for giving EUONGELION a try.

**If you can still access your old email:**
I'll send a verification to your current email to confirm the change. Once you click that link, you'll be all set.

**If you can't access your old email:**
I'll need you to answer a security question or provide some account details so I can verify it's really you. Can you tell me:
- When (approximately) did you create your account?
- What series/pathway were you matched to?

Once verified, I'll update your email and send a fresh login link to your new address.

Thank you for writing - I can tell you care deeply about getting theology right, and I respect that.

**The concern you raised:** [Summarize accurately]

Here's our perspective:

[Explain the reasoning behind the interpretation without being defensive. Cite sources if relevant.]

We recognize that faithful Christians sometimes disagree on [this issue]. Our approach is to present what we believe is a faithful reading of Scripture while acknowledging other perspectives exist. We try to be clear about when something is settled orthodoxy vs. an area where godly people differ.

If you'd like to discuss this further, I'm happy to continue the conversation. We don't claim to have everything figured out, and iron sharpens iron.

### 6.2 Question About Denominational Stance

**Example Tickets:**

- "What denomination is this?"
- "Do you believe in [specific doctrine]?"
- "Is this Catholic/Protestant/Orthodox?"

**Response Template:**

```
Subject: Re: About Our Theological Approach

Hi [Name],

Great question! Here's where we stand:

**EUONGELION is non-denominational** - we're not affiliated with any particular church or tradition. Our content is grounded in historic Christian orthodoxy (the things Christians have believed across time and traditions).

**What we believe:**
- The authority of Scripture
- The Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit)
- Salvation through grace by faith in Jesus Christ
- The historic creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian)

**Where we're generous:**
- Secondary issues where Christians disagree (baptism mode, church governance, end times specifics, etc.)
- We try to present various perspectives fairly when covering disputed topics

Our goal is to help people encounter Jesus through Scripture, not to advocate for a particular denomination or tradition.

Does that help? Happy to clarify further.

Grace and peace,
[Your name]
