| 2026-02-18 | pending | SA-004, SA-013 | F-024      | Added explicit crisis-support panel in Soul Audit results with prompt + actionable resource links (call/text), immediate-help CTA, and stricter crisis acknowledgement guidance. Consent/select APIs now return crisis detail payloads on gate failures for deterministic UI recovery.                                        | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 4 -> 7      | Manual legal/content review for crisis copy and escalation wording still required.  |
| 2026-02-20 | pending | SA-011, SA-024 | F-024      | Reworked Soul Audit results IA so users land directly on path options after input (3 primary options, curated starter paths, optional saved paths, single-action reroll, reset at bottom). Removed cookie-consent UI from this screen and kept crisis acknowledgement as the only runtime gate when crisis mode is triggered. | `lint`, `type-check`, live browser check | 7 -> 8      | Continue founder validation of crisis-language tone and mobile readability density. |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Add browser-level crisis-flow interaction test (resource links + ack + unlock)
- [ ] Run copy/legal review of crisis-support wording before production freeze
