## Device Contracts

### Desktop

- Primary interaction path is discoverable in one clear route.
- Error and recovery states are visible and actionable.

### Mobile

- Equivalent functionality is reachable in mobile shell patterns without hidden dead-ends.
- Touch targets and readability remain usable at 375/390 widths.

## Scope

### In scope

- Feature behavior and UX quality for: Curated curation quality
- Tracking and regression prevention for this feature

### Out of scope

| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-005                 | F-023      | Added repository-backed metadata fallback candidates and plan-coherence selection rules, preventing empty curated pools and reducing random plan assembly behavior.                                                                                            | `type-check`, `lint`, `test` (`soul-audit-flow`, `curation`, edge) | 4 -> 7 (engineering) | Manual quality review of generated copy tone.              |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-005, SA-013, SA-014 | F-023      | Tightened option specificity by making title/question/preview copy input-led (core burden extraction + input-term weighting), while preserving scripture-first preview structure. Added regression coverage for user-language anchoring in primary AI options. | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*`                           | 7 -> 7.8             | Founder tone acceptance and live prompt QA still required. |
| 2026-02-18 | pending | SA-013, SA-014         | F-023      | Added submit-time curation telemetry capture for every audit run (split validity, fallback strategy, avg confidence, matched-term trace, response excerpt) and persisted it through repository storage for ranking explainability/debugging.                   | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*`                           | 7.8 -> 8.2           | Founder prompt-pack QA and manual mobile evidence pending. |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Validate option relevance quality with founder-provided audit prompts
- [ ] Add dashboard/readout for telemetry trends and fallback rates
