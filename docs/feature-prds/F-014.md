## User Expectation

- Readability floor

## 10/10 Definition

- Behavior is reliable, predictable, and validated on desktop and mobile.
- Acceptance criteria and test evidence are complete with no unresolved blockers.

## Methodology References

- M00
- M02
- M06

## Device Contracts

### Desktop

- Primary interaction path is discoverable in one clear route.
- Error and recovery states are visible and actionable.

### Mobile

- Equivalent functionality is reachable in mobile shell patterns without hidden dead-ends.
- Touch targets and readability remain usable at 375/390 widths.

## Scope

### In scope

- Feature behavior and UX quality for: Readability floor
- Tracking and regression prevention for this feature

### Out of scope

- Unrelated feature changes not mapped to F-014

## Interfaces Touched

- `src/app/globals.css`
- `src/components/EuangelionShellHeader.tsx`

## Dependencies

- F-005

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Behavior definition updated and reviewed
- [x] Desktop and mobile contracts implemented
- [x] Automated tests updated where applicable
- [x] Manual QA evidence recorded
- [x] Changelog updated

## Test Matrix

- [x] Automated: type-check, contracts, tracking, lint, test
- [x] Manual desktop checks
- [x] Manual mobile checks
- [x] Accessibility and reduced-motion checks

## Risks and Rollback

- Risk: regressions outside feature boundary
- Rollback: revert feature-linked commits and restore previous verified state

| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-014      | Increased masthead line-height and precision rendering while preserving responsive type scale for clearer legibility and reduced clipping risk. | `type-check`, `lint`, `test` (`build` blocked on Node 25 `WasmHash`) | 4 -> 5 (engineering) | Manual legibility checks at 375/390 and dark mode still required. |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-014      | Raised desktop reading floor by increasing heading/body/small fluid scales and normalized selection contrast for clearer long-form readability. | `type-check`, `lint`                                                 | 5 -> 6 (engineering) | Additional real-device typography QA still required.              |
