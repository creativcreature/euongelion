## Metadata

- Feature ID: F-038
- Category: Reliability
- Owner: Engineering + Product
- Status: in-progress
- Slug: reliability-api-abuse-controls

## Scores

- Baseline Score: 5/10
- Engineering Score: 5/10
- Founder Score: 0/10
- Founder 10/10 Rule: only founder can assign 10/10

## User Expectation

- API abuse controls

## 10/10 Definition

- Behavior is reliable, predictable, and validated on desktop and mobile.
- Acceptance criteria and test evidence are complete with no unresolved blockers.

## Methodology References

- M00

## Device Contracts

### Desktop

- Primary interaction path is discoverable in one clear route.
- Error and recovery states are visible and actionable.

### Mobile

- Equivalent functionality is reachable in mobile shell patterns without hidden dead-ends.
- Touch targets and readability remain usable at 375/390 widths.

## Scope

### In scope

- Feature behavior and UX quality for: API abuse controls
- Tracking and regression prevention for this feature

### Out of scope

- Unrelated feature changes not mapped to F-038

## Dependencies

- F-039

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Behavior definition updated and reviewed
- [x] Desktop and mobile contracts implemented
- [x] Automated tests updated where applicable
- [ ] Manual QA evidence recorded
- [x] Changelog updated

## Test Matrix

- [x] Automated: type-check, contracts, tracking, lint, test
- [ ] Manual desktop checks
- [ ] Manual mobile checks
- [ ] Accessibility and reduced-motion checks

## Risks and Rollback

- Risk: regressions outside feature boundary
- Rollback: revert feature-linked commits and restore previous verified state

| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013, SA-014 | F-038      | Hardened shared rate-limit engine with bounded in-memory bucket pruning and richer metadata (`limit`, `remaining`, `reset`), then propagated richer rate-limit headers across core APIs. Added abuse-control regression tests for metadata and header behavior. | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 5 -> 7 (engineering) | Manual abuse-load QA still needed on deployed environment with real proxy headers. |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Validate rate-limit header behavior through CDN/proxy in production-like environment
- [ ] Add dashboard visibility for high-rate abuse events and burst patterns
