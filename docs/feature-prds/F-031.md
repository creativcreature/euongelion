| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-031      | Added active-day progression contract in `/api/daily-bread/active-days` with status + lock metadata, then surfaced locked-day teaser cards (title/scripture/unlock time/reminder toggle) in `Today + 7 Days` rail for clearer progression context. | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 4 -> 7 (engineering) | Manual QA still needed for mobile tap ergonomics and keyboard navigation polish. |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Capture manual desktop/mobile evidence for teaser and reminder toggle interactions
- [ ] Add keyboard traversal test coverage for locked teaser controls
