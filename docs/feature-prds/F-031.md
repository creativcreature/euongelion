- Error and recovery states are visible and actionable.

### Mobile

- Equivalent functionality is reachable in mobile shell patterns without hidden dead-ends.
- Touch targets and readability remain usable at 375/390 widths.

## Scope

### In scope

- Feature behavior and UX quality for: Day progression display
- Tracking and regression prevention for this feature

### Out of scope

- Unrelated feature changes not mapped to F-031

## Interfaces Touched

- `src/app/api/daily-bread/active-days/route.ts`
- `src/components/DevotionalLibraryRail.tsx`
- `__tests__/daily-bread-active-days.test.ts`

## Dependencies

- F-030

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Behavior definition updated and reviewed
- [x] Desktop and mobile contracts implemented
- [x] Automated tests updated where applicable

| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-031      | Added active-day progression contract in `/api/daily-bread/active-days` with status + lock metadata, then surfaced locked-day teaser cards (title/scripture/unlock time/reminder toggle) in `Today + 7 Days` rail for clearer progression context.                                  | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*`                    | 4 -> 7 (engineering) | Manual QA still needed for mobile tap ergonomics and keyboard navigation polish. |
| 2026-02-19 | pending | SA-011                 | F-031      | Replaced stacked Soul Audit devotional rendering with URL-addressable single-day view (`?day=N`), synced top strip + left rail day controls, added locked-day teaser state in main column, and updated rail deep links to day-specific routes.                                      | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*`                    | 7 -> 8 (engineering) | Needs founder visual pass for final pacing/spacing tuning on long-plan sessions. |
| 2026-02-20 | pending | SA-018                 | F-031      | Normalized Soul Audit plan-day artifact scoping by switching reader highlight/sticky slug identity to `plan-<token>-day-<n>`, then attached sticky-note overlay to plan-day reader stage so plan days match devotional tooling and library routes resolve to the exact day context. | `lint`, `type-check`, `test` (`soul-audit-flow`, `chat-ux`) | 8 -> 8.6             | Founder QA still needed for tactile review of overlay density on long plan days. |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Capture founder QA evidence for single-day reader pacing on desktop/mobile
- [ ] Add explicit browser back/forward manual script for day URL transitions
