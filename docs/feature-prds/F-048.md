- F-047

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Behavior definition updated and reviewed
- [x] Desktop and mobile contracts implemented
- [x] Automated tests updated where applicable
- [ ] Manual QA evidence recorded

| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013, SA-014 | F-048      | Added explicit billing lifecycle states (`processing`, `requires_action`, `restore_*`, `failed`, etc.) to flash resolver and surfaced lifecycle status feedback in Settings billing UI with polite live announcements. Extended lifecycle regression tests for restore/failure states. | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 4 -> 6.8    | Needs full webhook-driven state sync and manual cross-device purchase/restore QA. |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Connect resolver states to webhook-confirmed subscription state transitions
- [ ] Add manual QA evidence for web + iOS purchase/restore lifecycle scripts
