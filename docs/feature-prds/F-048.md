| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013, SA-014 | F-048      | Added explicit billing lifecycle states (`processing`, `requires_action`, `restore_*`, `failed`, etc.) to flash resolver and surfaced lifecycle status feedback in Settings billing UI with polite live announcements. Extended lifecycle regression tests for restore/failure states. | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 4 -> 6.8    | Needs full webhook-driven state sync and manual cross-device purchase/restore QA. |
| 2026-02-18 | pending | SA-013, SA-014 | F-048      | Added runtime lifecycle reconciliation in Settings: when `session_id` is present, Settings now queries billing lifecycle API to resolve canonical status from Stripe checkout/subscription state before showing lifecycle flash copy. Added lifecycle resolver unit coverage.          | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 6.8 -> 7.2  | Still needs webhook-driven async lifecycle finalization and physical-device QA.   |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Connect resolver states to webhook-confirmed subscription state transitions
- [ ] Add manual QA evidence for web + iOS purchase/restore lifecycle scripts
