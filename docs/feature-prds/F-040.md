## User Expectation

- Offline/degraded states

## 10/10 Definition

- Behavior is reliable, predictable, and validated on desktop and mobile.
- Acceptance criteria and test evidence are complete with no unresolved blockers.

## Methodology References

- M00

## Device Contracts

### Desktop

- Primary interaction path is discoverable in one clear route.
- Error and recovery states are visible and actionable.

### Mobile

- Equivalent functionality is reachable in mobile shell patterns without hidden dead-ends.
- Touch targets and readability remain usable at 375/390 widths.

## Scope

### In scope

- Feature behavior and UX quality for: Offline/degraded states
- Tracking and regression prevention for this feature

### Out of scope

- Unrelated feature changes not mapped to F-040

## Interfaces Touched

- `src/components/NetworkStatusBanner.tsx`
- `src/app/providers.tsx`
- `src/app/soul-audit/page.tsx`
- `src/components/ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx`
- `public/sw.js`
- `src/app/globals.css`
- `__tests__/network-status-banner.test.tsx`
- `__tests__/offline-sw-contract.test.ts`

## Dependencies

- F-001

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Behavior definition updated and reviewed
- [x] Desktop and mobile contracts implemented
- [x] Automated tests updated where applicable
- [ ] Manual QA evidence recorded
- [x] Changelog updated

## Test Matrix

- [x] Automated: type-check, contracts, tracking, lint, test
- [ ] Manual desktop checks
- [ ] Manual mobile checks
- [ ] Accessibility and reduced-motion checks

## Risks and Rollback

- Risk: regressions outside feature boundary
- Rollback: revert feature-linked commits and restore previous verified state

| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013, SA-014 | F-040      | Added global offline/degraded UX support: connectivity status banner, offline-specific Soul Audit submit messaging, and stronger service-worker caching for static assets/fonts plus critical route precache. Added regression tests for banner behavior and SW contracts. | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 4 -> 6.2    | Needs production device QA with real airplane-mode transitions and PWA install flows. |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Validate iOS Safari + Android Chrome offline transitions with installed PWA shells
- [ ] Add retry affordances on chat/save mutations when connectivity is restored
