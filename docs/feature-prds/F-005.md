- Error and recovery states are visible and actionable.

### Mobile

- Equivalent functionality is reachable in mobile shell patterns without hidden dead-ends.
- Touch targets and readability remain usable at 375/390 widths.

## Scope

### In scope

| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-005      | Unified masthead sizing behavior through shared shell header, removed duplicated homepage masthead controller, and widened fit bounds to prevent clipping and under-fill. | `type-check`, `lint`, `test` (`build` blocked on Node 25 `WasmHash`) | 4 -> 5 (engineering) | Manual breakpoint QA and visual parity review still required. |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013                 | F-005      | Refined masthead fit safety margin and line-height to preserve full-width impact while reducing horizontal/vertical clipping risk across breakpoints.                     | `type-check`, `lint`, `test` (`shell-header`)                        | 5 -> 5.4             | Manual visual QA across devices still required.               |
