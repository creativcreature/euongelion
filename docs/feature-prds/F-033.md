| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-008, SA-013, SA-014 | F-033      | Added explicit API guardrail metadata (`local-corpus-only`, no internet search) and surfaced scope messaging in chat UI.                                                                       | `type-check`, `lint`, `test` (64 pass)   | 5 -> 5 (engineering) | Manual device QA and wording refinement still required.                |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-008, SA-013, SA-014 | F-033      | Hardened chat contract to fail closed when devotional context cannot be resolved from local corpus and when reference corpus is unavailable; added regression for unresolved devotional slugs. | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 5 -> 7 (engineering) | Manual QA still needed for edge-case messaging tone on mobile/desktop. |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Validate copy tone and recovery steps for 400/503 guardrail failures
- [ ] Add UI-level empty-state handoff from chat modal to devotional open action
