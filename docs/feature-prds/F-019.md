| 2026-02-18 | pending | SA-013, SA-014 | F-019      | Added shared client submit transport with timeout/offline/server failure classification, wired homepage + `/soul-audit` to use it, and added retry affordances for failed submissions so users can recover without retyping. | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 5 -> 7      | Manual mobile-network QA still required for timeout/retry ergonomics. |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Add browser-level timeout and retry UX integration tests (Playwright)
- [ ] Tune timeout thresholds from production telemetry once available
