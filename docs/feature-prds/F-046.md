## User Expectation

- Screen reader semantics

## 10/10 Definition

- Behavior is reliable, predictable, and validated on desktop and mobile.
- Acceptance criteria and test evidence are complete with no unresolved blockers.

## Methodology References

- M00
- M04

## Device Contracts

### Desktop

- Primary interaction path is discoverable in one clear route.
- Error and recovery states are visible and actionable.

### Mobile

- Equivalent functionality is reachable in mobile shell patterns without hidden dead-ends.
- Touch targets and readability remain usable at 375/390 widths.

## Scope

### In scope

- Feature behavior and UX quality for: Screen reader semantics
- Tracking and regression prevention for this feature

### Out of scope

- Unrelated feature changes not mapped to F-046

| ---------- | ------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013, SA-014 | F-046      | Added explicit `main-content` landmark targets across core routes so skip links resolve consistently, upgraded shell topbar date to semantic `<time>` element with polite live updates, and improved mobile secondary-nav/menu ARIA state exposure. Added landmark and shell semantics regression contracts. | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 4 -> 6.9    | Manual screen-reader traversal (VoiceOver/NVDA/TalkBack) and announcements audit still required. |
| 2026-02-18 | pending | SA-013, SA-014 | F-046      | Added screen-reader-friendly labels for locked-day teaser controls and archive actions in the Daily Bread rail, and added explicit accessibility test coverage for these labeled control surfaces.                                                                                                           | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 6.9 -> 7.2  | Manual VoiceOver/TalkBack announcement quality review still pending.                             |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Run manual screen-reader scripts on desktop/mobile for header + route landmarks
- [x] Add contextual labels for day cards and archive rows in Daily Bread rail
