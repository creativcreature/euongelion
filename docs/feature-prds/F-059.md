# F-059: Create Missing Soul Audit Supabase Tables

**Status:** Implemented
**Priority:** Critical (cascade generation completely broken — 0 of 7 days forever)

---

## Problem

The Soul Audit cascade day generation (`/api/soul-audit/generate-next`) returned "Plan not found" for every request, causing all 7 days to stay in "BUILDING" state indefinitely. Users waited 30+ minutes seeing 0/7 days ready.

## Root Cause

The Soul Audit tables were never created in Supabase. The database migrations (001-008) cover the original series/devotionals/bookmarks schema, but none of the tables required by the Soul Audit flow:

- `audit_runs`
- `audit_options`
- `audit_option_telemetry`
- `consent_records`
- `audit_selections`
- `devotional_plan_instances`
- `devotional_plan_days`
- `devotional_day_citations`
- `mock_account_sessions`
- `annotations`

The `safeInsert()` and `safeUpsert()` functions in `repository.ts` silently swallowed ALL errors with `catch { // no-op }`, so these failures were invisible in logs. Data only existed in the serverless function's in-memory store for the duration of that single invocation.

### Why selection appeared to work

The submit and select endpoints happened to run in the same (or warm) Vercel instance, so in-memory data persisted across those requests. The select response included plan data that the client stored in sessionStorage. But when `generate-next` ran in a different instance, it had empty memory and nothing in Supabase.

## Fix

1. **Migration 009**: Creates all missing tables with proper indices, foreign keys, and RLS.
2. **Error logging**: Replaced silent `catch { // no-op }` in `safeInsert`/`safeUpsert` with `console.error` logging so failures appear in Vercel function logs.

## Deployment

The migration must be run in the Supabase SQL editor **before** cascade generation will work:

```
database/migrations/009_create_soul_audit_tables.sql
```

## Files Changed

- `database/migrations/009_create_soul_audit_tables.sql` (new)
- `src/lib/soul-audit/repository.ts` (error logging)
- `docs/feature-prds/F-059.md` (this file)

## Verification

After running the migration:

1. Start a new Soul Audit
2. Select an `ai_generative` option
3. Days should progress from "BUILDING" to complete (1 by 1, ~15-20s each)
4. Each completed day should contain real RAG references in endnotes
