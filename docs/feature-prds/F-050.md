| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013, SA-014 | F-050      | Added machine-validated App Store metadata contract and test evidence artifact, and hardened `verify:appstore-gate` to enforce release-gate sections, metadata limits (description/keywords), URL quality, review contact completeness, iOS product IDs, and evidence document structure. | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 4 -> 7.1    | Manual App Store Connect upload, screenshot set, and physical-device evidence completion still required pre-submit. |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Complete all unchecked App Store test evidence items with links to recordings/screenshots
- [ ] Attach finalized metadata values (build number, reviewer credentials, support phone) before archive upload
