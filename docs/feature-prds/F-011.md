## Device Contracts

### Desktop

- Primary interaction path is discoverable in one clear route.
- Error and recovery states are visible and actionable.

### Mobile

- Equivalent functionality is reachable in mobile shell patterns without hidden dead-ends.
- Touch targets and readability remain usable at 375/390 widths.

## Scope

### In scope

- Feature behavior and UX quality for: Menu correctness
- Tracking and regression prevention for this feature

### Out of scope

- Unrelated feature changes not mapped to F-011

## Interfaces Touched

- `src/components/EuangelionShellHeader.tsx`
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- `src/app/globals.css`
- `__tests__/shell-header.test.tsx`

## Dependencies

- F-009
- F-010

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Behavior definition updated and reviewed
- [x] Desktop and mobile contracts implemented
- [x] Automated tests updated where applicable
- [ ] Manual QA evidence recorded
- [x] Changelog updated

## Test Matrix

- [x] Automated: type-check, contracts, tracking, lint, test
- [ ] Manual desktop checks
- [ ] Manual mobile checks
- [ ] Accessibility and reduced-motion checks

## Risks and Rollback

- Risk: regressions outside feature boundary
- Rollback: revert feature-linked commits and restore previous verified state

| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-011      | Removed duplicated homepage header/navigation logic and consolidated route menu rendering into shared shell header across pages.                                                                        | `type-check`, `lint`, `test` (`build` blocked on Node 25 `WasmHash`) | 4 -> 5 (engineering) | Manual route walkthrough still required for full 10/10 signoff. |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-011      | Mobile shell polish pass: improved sticky mobile nav/ticker layout, adjusted responsive type scale/spacing, and reduced masthead clipping/overflow risk on narrow screens.                              | `type-check`, `lint`, `test` (64 pass)                               | 5 -> 6 (engineering) | Manual mobile QA on physical devices still required.            |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-011      | Added reusable breadcrumb navigation across recommendation-flow pages (`/series`, `/wake-up`, series detail, devotional detail, `/soul-audit/results`, `/my-devotional`) with shared newspaper styling. | `type-check`, `lint`, `test` (64 pass)                               | 6 -> 7 (engineering) | Manual UX copy pass may still refine breadcrumb labels.         |
