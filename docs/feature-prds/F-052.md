## Implementation

### Build-time manifest

- `scripts/generate-artwork-manifest.mjs` reads artwork.json files, generates typed manifest
- Hero scoring: named artist (+3), painting (+3), sculpture (+2), pre-1800 (+1), day-1 (+2)
- Round-robin redistribution fills every devotional to 3+ artworks
- Output: `src/data/artwork-manifest.ts` with SERIES_HERO, DEVOTIONAL_ARTWORKS, ALL_ARTWORKS

### Series card heroes

- Full-bleed background with scrim gradient for text readability
- CSS-only dark/light switching (both variants render, opacity toggled)
- Applied to BrowseSeriesCard, homepage featured cards, SeriesHero fallback

### Inline devotional artwork

- DevotionalArtwork component with cinematic 4:3 frames
- ArtworkAttribution component (compact inline + full museum card)
- artwork-placement.ts calculates insertion points between modules

### Lightbox gallery

- ArtworkLightbox with full museum card attribution
- Navigation: swipe, arrow keys, Escape close
- Focus trap + body scroll lock

## Outcomes Log

- 2026-02-22: Initial implementation complete. 319 artworks mapped, 32 heroes, 170 devotionals with 3+ images. Series card heroes visually verified at desktop, mobile (375px), dark and light mode. Devotional inline artwork verified via type-check + lint + build (visual QA blocked by pre-existing CSP hydration issue in dev).
