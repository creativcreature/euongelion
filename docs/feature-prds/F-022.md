## Device Contracts

### Desktop

- Primary interaction path is discoverable in one clear route.
- Error and recovery states are visible and actionable.

### Mobile

- Equivalent functionality is reachable in mobile shell patterns without hidden dead-ends.
- Touch targets and readability remain usable at 375/390 widths.

## Scope

### In scope

- Feature behavior and UX quality for: Selection locking
- Tracking and regression prevention for this feature

### Out of scope

- `src/app/soul-audit/results/page.tsx`

## Dependencies

- F-019
- F-021
- F-023

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Behavior definition updated and reviewed
- [x] Desktop and mobile contracts implemented
- [x] Automated tests updated where applicable
- [ ] Manual QA evidence recorded
- [x] Changelog updated

## Test Matrix

- [x] Automated: type-check, contracts, tracking, lint, test

| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013, SA-014 | F-022      | Added session-backed audit input persistence and run-expiration recovery flow on results page (`Reload Options`) so stale run IDs no longer force a full restart when user input is still available. Also aligned reroll to the same persisted input source for post-refresh reliability. | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 5 -> 7.1    | Manual multi-tab/session churn QA still needed across mobile and desktop.     |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013, SA-014 | F-022      | Added explicit run-recovery contract tests to lock session-backed input persistence and expired-run reload affordance across homepage submit/reset and results flows.                                                                                                                     | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 7.1 -> 7.4  | Browser E2E for expired-run recovery still pending (typed flow + limit edge). |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Add browser-level integration test coverage for run-expired recovery flow
- [ ] Validate behavior against exhausted audit-cycle edge cases
