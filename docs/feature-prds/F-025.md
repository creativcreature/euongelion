| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-005       | F-025      | Curated builder now prioritizes coherent preferred-series day flow, then fills from ranked corpus candidates only when needed so plan creation remains reliable and curated-first instead of failing. | `type-check`, `lint`, `test` (`soul-audit-flow`, `curation`, edge) | 4 -> 7 (engineering) | Needs manual editorial pass for long-form polish quality. |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Add structured observability for candidate-selection fallback usage
- [ ] Run founder QA on devotional depth/length against acceptance prompts
