| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-003, SA-014 | F-037      | Added canonical retention-policy contract (`src/lib/privacy/retention.ts`) and surfaced it in session/export APIs plus Settings UI with human-readable summaries (anonymous, bookmarks, notes/highlights/chat, archive/trash windows). | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 4 -> 7 (engineering) | Manual legal/content review still needed to ensure policy language alignment with public legal pages. |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Align retention copy with Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy legal text
- [ ] Add link-level traceability from settings retention text to legal docs
