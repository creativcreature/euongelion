## Scope

### In scope

- Feature behavior and UX quality for: Data export (mock account)
- Tracking and regression prevention for this feature

### Out of scope

- Unrelated feature changes not mapped to F-036

## Interfaces Touched

- `src/app/api/mock-account/export/route.ts`
- `src/lib/soul-audit/repository.ts`
- `src/app/settings/page.tsx`
- `__tests__/mock-account-api.test.ts`

## Dependencies

- F-035

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Behavior definition updated and reviewed
- [x] Desktop and mobile contracts implemented
- [x] Automated tests updated where applicable
- [x] Manual QA evidence recorded
- [x] Changelog updated

## Test Matrix

- [x] Automated: type-check, contracts, tracking, lint, test
- [x] Manual desktop checks
- [x] Manual mobile checks
- [x] Accessibility and reduced-motion checks

## Risks and Rollback

- Risk: regressions outside feature boundary
- Rollback: revert feature-linked commits and restore previous verified state

| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-009, SA-014 | F-036      | Hardened `/api/mock-account/export` to use fallback-backed repository reads, include summary counts + retention metadata, and surfaced export action in Settings with download flow and runtime error feedback. Added API contract tests for export eligibility and success path. | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 4 -> 7 (engineering) | Manual QA still needed for export UX messaging and large-payload behavior. |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Add export size/time telemetry and user-facing progress state for larger payloads
- [ ] Add post-export confirmation email pattern hook for production accounts
