## Device Contracts

### Desktop

- Primary interaction path is discoverable in one clear route.
- Error and recovery states are visible and actionable.

### Mobile

- Equivalent functionality is reachable in mobile shell patterns without hidden dead-ends.
- Touch targets and readability remain usable at 375/390 widths.

## Scope

### In scope

- Feature behavior and UX quality for: Sticky desktop nav
- Tracking and regression prevention for this feature

### Out of scope

- Unrelated feature changes not mapped to F-009

## Interfaces Touched

- `src/components/EuangelionShellHeader.tsx`
- `src/app/globals.css`
- `__tests__/shell-header.test.tsx`

## Dependencies

- F-011

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Behavior definition updated and reviewed
- [x] Desktop and mobile contracts implemented
- [x] Automated tests updated where applicable
- [ ] Manual QA evidence recorded
- [x] Changelog updated

## Test Matrix

- [x] Automated: type-check, contracts, tracking, lint, test

| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-009      | Replaced observer-only docking with deterministic scroll/resize dock computation to keep desktop sticky transition stable.                                    | `type-check`, `lint`, `test` (`build` blocked on Node 25 `WasmHash`) | 4 -> 5 (engineering) | Manual cross-browser sticky QA still required.   |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013                 | F-009      | Removed clipping overflow from primary frame containers so sticky topbar/nav does not inherit unstable sticky containment on inner routes.                    | `type-check`, `lint`, `test` (`shell-header`), contract gates        | 5 -> 5.4             | Manual Safari/iOS sticky behavior still needed.  |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013                 | F-009      | Calibrated nav sticky offset to measured topbar height (`--shell-topbar-height`) so dock math remains accurate when topbar height shifts by viewport/content. | `type-check`, `lint`, `test` (`shell-header`)                        | 5.4 -> 5.8           | Manual cross-browser viewport QA still required. |
