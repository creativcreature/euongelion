- Primary interaction path is discoverable in one clear route.
- Error and recovery states are visible and actionable.

### Mobile

- Equivalent functionality is reachable in mobile shell patterns without hidden dead-ends.
- Touch targets and readability remain usable at 375/390 widths.

## Scope

### In scope

- Feature behavior and UX quality for: Contrast & readability
- Tracking and regression prevention for this feature

### Out of scope

- Unrelated feature changes not mapped to F-045

## Interfaces Touched

- `src/app/globals.css`

## Dependencies

- F-014

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Behavior definition updated and reviewed
- [x] Desktop and mobile contracts implemented
- [x] Automated tests updated where applicable
- [ ] Manual QA evidence recorded
- [x] Changelog updated

## Test Matrix

- [x] Automated: type-check, contracts, tracking, lint, test
- [ ] Manual desktop checks
- [ ] Manual mobile checks
- [ ] Accessibility and reduced-motion checks

## Risks and Rollback

- Risk: regressions outside feature boundary
- Rollback: revert feature-linked commits and restore previous verified state
