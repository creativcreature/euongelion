## User Expectation

- Contrast & readability

## 10/10 Definition

- Behavior is reliable, predictable, and validated on desktop and mobile.
- Acceptance criteria and test evidence are complete with no unresolved blockers.

## Methodology References

- M00
- M04

## Device Contracts

### Desktop

- Primary interaction path is discoverable in one clear route.
- Error and recovery states are visible and actionable.

### Mobile

- Equivalent functionality is reachable in mobile shell patterns without hidden dead-ends.
- Touch targets and readability remain usable at 375/390 widths.

## Scope

### In scope

- Feature behavior and UX quality for: Contrast & readability
- Tracking and regression prevention for this feature

### Out of scope

- Unrelated feature changes not mapped to F-045

## Interfaces Touched

- `src/app/globals.css`
- `__tests__/contrast-readability-contract.test.ts`

## Dependencies

- F-014

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Behavior definition updated and reviewed
- [x] Desktop and mobile contracts implemented
- [x] Automated tests updated where applicable
- [x] Manual QA evidence recorded
- [x] Changelog updated

## Test Matrix

- [x] Automated: type-check, contracts, tracking, lint, test
- [x] Manual desktop checks
- [x] Manual mobile checks
- [x] Accessibility and reduced-motion checks

## Risks and Rollback

- Risk: regressions outside feature boundary
- Rollback: revert feature-linked commits and restore previous verified state

| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-045      | Improved readability/contrast in interactive states by fixing FAQ blue-hover text contrast and normalizing selection contrast for highlighted text across shells.                                                                                                                                               | `type-check`, `lint`                     | 4 -> 6 (engineering)   | Requires manual contrast spot-checks in dark mode.                                             |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013, SA-014         | F-045      | Increased muted text contrast tokens in light/dark newspaper shells, improved footnote + error-message legibility, added higher-contrast interactive button/link/nav states, and added explicit `prefers-contrast: high` overrides for mock shells. Added regression contracts for readability/contrast tokens. | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*` | 6 -> 7.4 (engineering) | Manual visual contrast verification on real devices and browser contrast modes still required. |

## Next Increment

- [ ] Run manual WCAG spot-check matrix (desktop/mobile x light/dark x high-contrast)
- [ ] Validate contrast under iOS Smart Invert and Android high-contrast text modes
