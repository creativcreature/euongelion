| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-029      | Restyled Wake Up route family (`/wake-up`, `/wake-up/series/[slug]`, `/wake-up/devotional/[slug]`) onto the same home newspaper shell (`mock-home`/`mock-paper`) with blue-ink typography, newsletter borders, explicit 3-column 7-question grid, and consistent devotional/series card framing.                         | `type-check`, `lint`, `test` (64 pass)         | 4 -> 6 (engineering) | Manual visual QA across breakpoints and dark mode fine-tuning still required.     |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-029      | Restored wake-up 7-question card rendering by sourcing directly from `WAKEUP_SERIES_ORDER`, preserving home-style series-card treatment while preventing missing-card states.                                                                                                                                            | `type-check`, `lint`                           | 6 -> 6 (engineering) | Manual route visual QA still required.                                            |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-029      | Formalized devotional spacing rhythm and mobile full-bleed behavior: devotional panels now use consistent spacing tokens, mobile removes left/right panel borders, and devotional pages use full viewport width for reading flow continuity.                                                                             | `type-check`, `lint`                           | 6 -> 7 (engineering) | Manual QA needed on narrow devices and notch-safe insets.                         |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-029      | Restyled `/my-devotional` into the same `mock-home`/`mock-paper` shell with shared header, breadcrumb row, and bordered panel rhythm so devotional-home continuity matches homepage/devotional structure.                                                                                                                | `type-check`, `lint`, `test`                   | 7 -> 8 (engineering) | Manual route-level QA still needed on mobile viewport spacing.                    |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013                 | F-029      | Introduced shared inner-page shell spacing utility and applied it across results/devotional/legal/settings/loading routes to align content rhythm with the homepage shell system.                                                                                                                                        | `type-check`, `lint`, `test`                   | 8 -> 8.2             | Visual QA still required for per-route optical alignment polish.                  |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013                 | F-029      | Unified sticky side-rail offsets with a shell-aware utility so results/devotional/library sidebars sit correctly below the shared sticky header stack across routes.                                                                                                                                                     | `type-check`, `lint`, `test`                   | 8.2 -> 8.4           | Visual QA still required for long-page sidebar behavior on smaller laptops.       |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013                 | F-029      | Added canonical `/daily-bread` route, updated devotional links away from legacy `/my-devotional`, and separated Wake-Up shell identity using `WAKE UP` masthead tone while preserving shared structural mechanics.                                                                                                       | `type-check`, `lint`, contracts/tracking gates | 8.4 -> 8.8           | Wake-Up warm-black polish still needs founder visual pass across all breakpoints. |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013                 | F-029      | Converted legacy `/my-devotional` route into a query-preserving redirect to `/daily-bread` so canonical devotional-home routing remains deterministic across old bookmarks and shared links.                                                                                                                             | `type-check`, `lint`, contracts/tracking gates | 8.8 -> 8.9           | Founder visual QA and archive UX polish remain pending.                           |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013                 | F-029      | Removed duplicate docked-menu behavior in shell header, restored persistent sticky nav stack, increased homepage desktop body-copy scale, aligned hero/CTA vertical rhythm, switched FAQ hover emphasis to answer-only blue reveal, and moved featured series to 3-card carousel groups without icon/image placeholders. | `type-check`, `lint`, contracts/tracking gates | 8.9 -> 9.1           | Final founder visual calibration still needed for exact typography proportions.   |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013                 | F-029      | Updated shell-header tests to enforce the new single-nav invariant and removed stale docked-nav assertions so CI now validates current production navigation behavior.                                                                                                                                                   | `test`                                         | 9.1 -> 9.2           | Final founder visual calibration still needed for exact typography proportions.   |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013                 | F-029      | Removed residual docked-nav CSS branches, synchronized sticky offset vars on both shell and paper containers, and bumped SW cache version to force stale homepage/header assets to refresh in production clients.                                                                                                        | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`                   | 9.2 -> 9.3           | Final founder visual calibration still needed for exact typography proportions.   |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013                 | F-029      | Hardened home featured-series behavior with explicit 3-card carousel slides + timed rotation, removed legacy media/icon strip rendering from card layout paths, and formalized shared hero/CTA panel vertical padding tokens for proportion consistency.                                                                 | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`                   | 9.3 -> 9.4           | Final founder visual calibration still needed for exact typography proportions.   |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013                 | F-029      | Added SW version-migration guard in client registration to unregister stale workers and clear legacy `euangelion-*` caches when version changes, ensuring production clients pick up updated homepage/header assets after deployment.                                                                                    | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`                   | 9.4 -> 9.5           | Final founder visual calibration still needed for exact typography proportions.   |
