| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-029      | Restyled Wake Up route family (`/wake-up`, `/wake-up/series/[slug]`, `/wake-up/devotional/[slug]`) onto the same home newspaper shell (`mock-home`/`mock-paper`) with blue-ink typography, newsletter borders, explicit 3-column 7-question grid, and consistent devotional/series card framing. | `type-check`, `lint`, `test` (64 pass) | 4 -> 6 (engineering) | Manual visual QA across breakpoints and dark mode fine-tuning still required. |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-029      | Restored wake-up 7-question card rendering by sourcing directly from `WAKEUP_SERIES_ORDER`, preserving home-style series-card treatment while preventing missing-card states.                                                                                                                    | `type-check`, `lint`                   | 6 -> 6 (engineering) | Manual route visual QA still required.                                        |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-029      | Formalized devotional spacing rhythm and mobile full-bleed behavior: devotional panels now use consistent spacing tokens, mobile removes left/right panel borders, and devotional pages use full viewport width for reading flow continuity.                                                     | `type-check`, `lint`                   | 6 -> 7 (engineering) | Manual QA needed on narrow devices and notch-safe insets.                     |
