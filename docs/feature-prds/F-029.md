| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-029      | Restyled Wake Up route family (`/wake-up`, `/wake-up/series/[slug]`, `/wake-up/devotional/[slug]`) onto the same home newspaper shell (`mock-home`/`mock-paper`) with blue-ink typography, newsletter borders, explicit 3-column 7-question grid, and consistent devotional/series card framing.                                                                                         | `type-check`, `lint`, `test` (64 pass)         | 4 -> 6 (engineering) | Manual visual QA across breakpoints and dark mode fine-tuning still required.           |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-029      | Restored wake-up 7-question card rendering by sourcing directly from `WAKEUP_SERIES_ORDER`, preserving home-style series-card treatment while preventing missing-card states.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | `type-check`, `lint`                           | 6 -> 6 (engineering) | Manual route visual QA still required.                                                  |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013, SA-014, SA-015 | F-029      | Formalized devotional spacing rhythm and mobile full-bleed behavior: devotional panels now use consistent spacing tokens, mobile removes left/right panel borders, and devotional pages use full viewport width for reading flow continuity.                                                                                                                                             | `type-check`, `lint`                           | 6 -> 7 (engineering) | Manual QA needed on narrow devices and notch-safe insets.                               |

| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013                 | F-029      | Introduced shared inner-page shell spacing utility and applied it across results/devotional/legal/settings/loading routes to align content rhythm with the homepage shell system.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `type-check`, `lint`, `test`                   | 8 -> 8.2             | Visual QA still required for per-route optical alignment polish.                        |
| 2026-02-14 | pending | SA-013                 | F-029      | Unified sticky side-rail offsets with a shell-aware utility so results/devotional/library sidebars sit correctly below the shared sticky header stack across routes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `type-check`, `lint`, `test`                   | 8.2 -> 8.4           | Visual QA still required for long-page sidebar behavior on smaller laptops.             |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013                 | F-029      | Added canonical `/daily-bread` route, updated devotional links away from legacy `/my-devotional`, and separated Wake-Up shell identity using `WAKE UP` masthead tone while preserving shared structural mechanics.                                                                                                                                                                       | `type-check`, `lint`, contracts/tracking gates | 8.4 -> 8.8           | Wake-Up warm-black polish still needs founder visual pass across all breakpoints.       |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013                 | F-029      | Converted legacy `/my-devotional` route into a query-preserving redirect to `/daily-bread` so canonical devotional-home routing remains deterministic across old bookmarks and shared links.                                                                                                                                                                                             | `type-check`, `lint`, contracts/tracking gates | 8.8 -> 8.9           | Founder visual QA and archive UX polish remain pending.                                 |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013                 | F-029      | Removed duplicate docked-menu behavior in shell header, restored persistent sticky nav stack, increased homepage desktop body-copy scale, aligned hero/CTA vertical rhythm, switched FAQ hover emphasis to answer-only blue reveal, and moved featured series to 3-card carousel groups without icon/image placeholders.                                                                 | `type-check`, `lint`, contracts/tracking gates | 8.9 -> 9.1           | Final founder visual calibration still needed for exact typography proportions.         |
| 2026-02-15 | pending | SA-013                 | F-029      | Updated shell-header tests to enforce the new single-nav invariant and removed stale docked-nav assertions so CI now validates current production navigation behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `test`                                         | 9.1 -> 9.2           | Final founder visual calibration still needed for exact typography proportions.         |

| 2026-02-18 | pending | SA-013, SA-014         | F-029      | Normalized `/soul-audit` and `/series` route shells to the same homepage frame (`mock-home` + `mock-paper`) and shared spacing utilities so top utility/nav stacks retain consistent sticky behavior, borders, and viewport rhythm across core main-nav routes.                                                                                                                          | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*`       | 10.0 -> 10.0         | Founder visual calibration for exact desktop proportions still required.                |
| 2026-02-18 | pending | SA-013, SA-014         | F-029      | Extended shell normalization to auth entry routes (`/auth/sign-in`, `/auth/sign-up`) so sign-in/up now inherit the same bounded newspaper frame, shared header stack, and spacing rhythm as homepage-level routes.                                                                                                                                                                       | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*`       | 10.0 -> 10.0         | Founder visual calibration for exact desktop proportions still required.                |
| 2026-02-18 | pending | SA-013, SA-014         | F-029      | Moved static/legal/help content surfaces onto the shared `mock-home` + `mock-paper` shell framing via `StaticInfoPage` and `HelpHubPageClient` so header/nav/border rhythm remains aligned with homepage structure across non-Wake-Up routes.                                                                                                                                            | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*`       | 10.0 -> 10.0         | Founder visual calibration for exact desktop proportions still required.                |
| 2026-02-18 | pending | SA-013, SA-014         | F-029      | Rebased `/soul-audit/results` (including loading/error states) onto the same `mock-home` + `mock-paper` shell contract as `/daily-bread`, preserving one continuous visual system and shared header/nav/frame behavior across core devotional routes.                                                                                                                                    | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*`       | 10.0 -> 10.0         | Founder pass still required for final route-by-route optical proportion tuning.         |
| 2026-02-18 | pending | SA-013, SA-014         | F-029      | Completed non-Wake-Up shell parity migration for utility/system surfaces by moving `/settings`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/offline`, root `loading/error/404`, and admin shell pages to the shared `mock-home` + `mock-paper` contract with the same masthead/nav/footer structure.                                                                                                         | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*`       | 10.0 -> 10.0         | Founder pass still required for final route-by-route optical proportion tuning.         |
| 2026-02-19 | pending | SA-011, SA-012         | F-029      | Fixed false “continue devotional” prompts by making homepage resume state server-authoritative and clearing stale client/session route state when no active current path exists. Updated `/api/soul-audit/current` to resolve the latest valid devotional path by timestamp so newer curated prefab selections can replace older AI-plan routes as the current home continuation target. | `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `verify:*`       | 10.0 -> 10.0         | Founder validation needed for expected continuity semantics between reset/select flows. |
