## What Learn Your Way Does

Google's Learn Your Way transforms static educational content into personalized, interactive learning experiences using AI. It adapts textbook materials to match individual learners.

## Core Principles (Learning Science)

Google built Learn Your Way on five learning science principles:

| Principle                   | What It Means                               | EUONGELION Application                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inspire Active Learning** | Learners engage, don't just consume         | Games as teaching (Match, Order, Reveal), Reflection prompts, Interactive modules |
| **Manage Cognitive Load**   | Don't overwhelm; chunk appropriately        | Day-gating (one day at a time), Module-based structure, Cinematic scroll pacing   |
| **Adapt to the Learner**    | Content meets them where they are           | Pathways (Sleep/Awake/Shepherd), User module preferences, Vocabulary calibration  |
| **Stimulate Curiosity**     | Create desire to know more                  | Hebrew word reveals, PaRDeS layers, Chiastic "pivot" structure                    |
| **Deepen Metacognition**    | Help learners understand their own learning | Reflection questions, Comprehension checks, Takeaway summaries                    |

## Key Features We Can Learn From

### 1. Content Re-Leveling

**What Google Does:**
Adapts reading level (Flesch-Kincaid) based on learner's reported grade while preserving content scope.

**EUONGELION Application:**

- Our pathways already do this conceptually (Sleep = accessible, Shepherd = dense)
- Could refine vocabulary complexity per pathway
- Same truth, different vocabulary — already our approach

**Action:** Ensure WRITER calibrates vocabulary intentionally per pathway. Create vocabulary guidelines.

---

### 2. Interest-Based Customization

**What Google Does:**
Learners select interests (sports, music, food). System embeds relevant analogies and examples. "Projectile motion" becomes basketball shots for one learner, guitar strings for another.

**EUONGELION Application:**

- Could let users indicate their "season" or "struggle" (work stress, relationship pain, doubt, loss)
- Examples in Teaching and Bridge modules could adapt
- Soul Audit already captures this — could use response to personalize examples

**Consideration:** Don't over-engineer. The Soul Audit response already tells us where they are. Use it wisely, not algorithmically.

---

### 3. Multiple Representations (Dual Coding Theory)

**What Google Does:**
Same content, multiple formats:

- Immersive text
- Quizzes
- Slides & narration
- Audio lessons
- Mind maps

**Research basis:** "Forging mental connections between different representations strengthens conceptual understanding."

**EUONGELION Application:**
We already have 21 modules — this IS multiple representation:

| Google Format        | EUONGELION Equivalent           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Immersive text       | Teaching, Story, Bridge         |
| Quizzes              | Comprehension, Match, Order     |
| Audio lessons        | Voice module                    |
| Mind maps / visuals  | Visual, Chronology, Geography   |
| Interactive elements | Reflection, Interactive, Reveal |

**Action:** We're already doing this well. Ensure variety in each day's module selection.

---

### 4. User Choice of Modality

**What Google Does:**
Students CHOOSE which representation to engage with. Not forced into one path.

**EUONGELION Application:**
User mentioned wanting users to set up devotionals with preferred modules.

**Approach (Without Overwhelm):**

- Default: Curated experience (we choose module order)
- Optional: "Customize your experience" — toggle module types on/off
- Start with defaults, surface customization after first series completion

**Consideration:** Don't front-load choices. Let them experience it first, then offer preferences.

---

### 5. Dynamic Feedback Loop

**What Google Does:**
Quizzes identify knowledge gaps → guides learner to revisit struggling areas → true personalization.

**EUONGELION Application:**

- Comprehension module results could surface related content
- "Didn't quite get hevel? Here's another angle..."
- Match/Order games give immediate feedback

**For MVP:** Keep it simple. Games give feedback. Don't build adaptive loops yet.

**Future:** Could track which modules users skip or spend time on → inform future recommendations.

## What We Should NOT Copy

| Google Does              | We Should NOT                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Heavy AI personalization | Over-rely on algorithms for spiritual content |
| Grade-level targeting    | Label people's "spiritual grade"              |
| Gamification metrics     | Turn devotional into achievement system       |
| Constant adaptation      | Change content so much it feels unstable      |

**Remember:** Technology is a tool, not a pastor. The Word does the work.

## Actionable Takeaways for EUONGELION

### Immediate (MVP)

1. **Ensure module variety per day** — Don't stack 5 teaching modules. Mix representations.
2. **Games as teaching, not testing** — Match, Order, Reveal clarify understanding, not grade it.
3. **Day-gating as cognitive load management** — One day at a time is a feature, not a limitation.
4. **Soul Audit response informs experience** — Use their words to personalize match reasoning.

### Near-Term (Post-MVP)

5. **Module preferences** — After first series, let users toggle preferred module types.
6. **Skip tracking** — Note which modules users skip → inform content creation.
7. **Interest/season indication** — Let users share their current struggle → adapt examples.

### Long-Term

8. **Audio-first option** — Some users prefer to listen (Voice module expansion).
9. **Visual summaries** — Mind-map style series overviews.
10. **Adaptive depth** — Surface more PaRDeS layers for engaged users.

## The Honest Frame

Google's Learn Your Way shows that personalization works — students using it scored 11% higher on retention tests.

But we're not optimizing for test scores. We're cultivating continued seeking of God.

**What we take:** Multiple representations, respect for cognitive load, user agency in experience.

**What we leave:** Algorithmic everything, metrics-driven adaptation, treating spiritual growth like a learning objective.
