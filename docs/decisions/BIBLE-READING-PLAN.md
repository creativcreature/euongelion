# DECISION: 365-Day Bible Reading Plan for EUONGELION

**Status:** PENDING FOUNDER DECISION
**Created:** January 17, 2026
**Decision Deadline:** Before content generation begins
**Related Docs:** `/content/DEVOTIONAL-STRATEGY.md`, `/docs/MVP-SCOPE.md`

---

## Executive Summary

The "Through-the-Bible" series is the **core spine** of EUONGELION content (365 devotionals, ~4,000 words each). This document presents options for:

1. **Reading plan philosophy** - What are we actually trying to accomplish?
2. **Plan structure** - How do we sequence Scripture across 365 days?
3. **Pacing** - How do users move through the year?
4. **Starting point** - When should users begin?
5. **Integration with Deep Dive format** - How does one passage become 4,000 words?

**The goal:** Help the founder make an informed decision before content generation begins.

## 1. Reading Plan Philosophy

### The Core Question

> What does it mean to go "through the Bible" in a year?

This isn't just a logistics question. It's a **theological and pedagogical** question that shapes everything.

### Three Philosophical Approaches

#### PHILOSOPHY A: The Complete Bible

**Goal:** Every verse, every chapter, every book.

- **Assumption:** Completeness equals faithfulness
- **Reality:** ~1,189 chapters / 365 days = 3.25 chapters/day average
- **Challenge:** Some chapters (Levitical laws, genealogies, minor prophets) are difficult to make compelling
- **EUONGELION fit:** Poor. A 4,000-word essay on Numbers 7's repetitive offerings would be painful.

#### PHILOSOPHY B: The Whole Story

**Goal:** Cover the entire biblical narrative arc, hitting every major movement, but not every verse.

- **Assumption:** The Bible is ONE story; readers need the whole arc, not every detail
- **Reality:** ~365 key passages selected to carry the narrative
- **Challenge:** Requires careful curation; some favorite passages may be skipped
- **EUONGELION fit:** Good. Aligns with "meta-story" emphasis in DEVOTIONAL-STRATEGY.md

#### PHILOSOPHY C: The Essential Bible

**Goal:** Focus on the most transformative passages; go deep rather than wide.

- **Assumption:** Better to know 100 passages deeply than 1,189 chapters shallowly
- **Reality:** ~150-200 essential passages, repeated themes, spiral learning
- **Challenge:** Not really "through the Bible" in any traditional sense
- **EUONGELION fit:** Mixed. Fits "deep not wide" philosophy but doesn't deliver the promised 365-day scope.

### RECOMMENDATION: Philosophy B - The Whole Story

**Reasoning:**

- Honors the meta-story thread central to EUONGELION identity
- Allows Deep Dive format to shine (one passage, fully explored)
- Still delivers "through the Bible" promise to users
- Avoids the "Leviticus death march" problem
- Maps to the existing distribution in DEVOTIONAL-STRATEGY.md

## 2. Plan Structure Options

### OPTION A: Chronological (Events in Historical Order)

**Description:** Scripture ordered by when events happened, not when books were written. Genesis 1-11 -> Job -> Genesis 12-50 -> Exodus -> etc.

**Sample Week (Week 12 - Wilderness):**
| Day | Passage | Theme |
|-----|---------|-------|
| 78 | Exodus 32:1-14 | Golden Calf |
| 79 | Exodus 34:1-9 | New Tablets |
| 80 | Numbers 13:1-14:10 | Spies and Fear |
| 81 | Numbers 20:1-13 | Moses Strikes the Rock |
| 82 | Psalm 90 | Moses' Prayer (chronologically placed) |
| 83 | Numbers 21:4-9 | Bronze Serpent |
| 84 | Deuteronomy 6:1-9 | The Shema |

**Pros:**

- Tells the story in sequence - readers understand cause and effect
- Integrates Psalms and wisdom literature at appropriate historical moments
- Reveals how prophets spoke into specific situations
- Makes the Gospels' different accounts complementary rather than repetitive

**Cons:**

- Jumps between books frequently (can feel fragmented)
- Scholars debate exact chronology (especially Job, some Psalms)
- No single book is read straight through
- Users can't easily "find their place" in a physical Bible

**Audience Fit:** Good for story-focused readers who want the narrative arc. May frustrate those who like systematic book-by-book study.

**Difficulty to Create:** Medium-High (requires research on chronological placement)

---

### OPTION B: Canonical (Genesis to Revelation)

**Description:** Read books in their traditional Bible order, start to finish.

**Sample Week (Week 8 - Leviticus/Numbers):**
| Day | Passage | Theme |
|-----|---------|-------|
| 50 | Leviticus 16:1-22 | Day of Atonement |
| 51 | Leviticus 19:1-18 | Holiness Code |
| 52 | Leviticus 23:1-14 | Feasts (Passover, Firstfruits) |
| 53 | Numbers 6:22-27 | Aaronic Blessing |
| 54 | Numbers 11:1-15 | Complaining in the Wilderness |
| 55 | Numbers 13:25-33 | Bad Report from Spies |
| 56 | Numbers 14:1-24 | Judgment and Caleb's Faith |

**Pros:**

- Familiar to most Bible readers
- Easy to track progress ("I'm in 1 Samuel now")
- Respects each book as a literary unit
- No scholarly debates about placement

**Cons:**

- Gets bogged down in difficult sections (Leviticus, Numbers, Chronicles)
- Psalms and Proverbs feel disconnected from narrative
- Revelation comes at year's end (powerful or problematic?)
- Front-loaded with law, back-loaded with letters

**Audience Fit:** Good for systematic readers. May lose engagement during difficult stretches.

**Difficulty to Create:** Low (follow standard order)

---

### OPTION C: Thematic/Topical

**Description:** Organize by themes that cycle throughout the year (Creation, Covenant, Kingdom, Exile, Restoration, Incarnation, Church).

**Sample Week (Week 15 - "Covenant"):**
| Day | Passage | Theme |
|-----|---------|-------|
| 99 | Genesis 15:1-21 | Abrahamic Covenant |
| 100 | Exodus 19:1-8 | Sinai Covenant |
| 101 | 2 Samuel 7:1-17 | Davidic Covenant |
| 102 | Jeremiah 31:31-34 | New Covenant Promised |
| 103 | Luke 22:14-20 | New Covenant Enacted |
| 104 | Hebrews 8:1-13 | Better Covenant Explained |
| 105 | Hebrews 9:11-28 | Covenant Sealed in Blood |

**Pros:**

- Variety every day (OT, NT, poetry, narrative, epistle)
- Teaches readers to see connections across Scripture
- Never gets stuck in difficult sections
- Great for the "meta-story" emphasis

**Cons:**

- Loses the narrative momentum
- Harder to follow the story
- Can feel artificially constructed
- Readers may not understand context of each passage

**Audience Fit:** Good for mature believers who already know the story. May confuse new believers.

**Difficulty to Create:** High (requires careful thematic mapping)

---

### OPTION D: Gospel-Centered Spiral

**Description:** Start with Jesus (Gospels), spiral outward to OT background, then spiral back to NT implications. Repeat in expanding circles.

**Sample Week (Week 1 - "The Word Made Flesh"):**
| Day | Passage | Theme |
|-----|---------|-------|
| 1 | John 1:1-18 | The Word Became Flesh |
| 2 | Genesis 1:1-5 | "In the beginning..." |
| 3 | Colossians 1:15-20 | Christ the Creator |
| 4 | Genesis 1:26-31 | Made in the Image |
| 5 | John 1:9-13 | Children of God |
| 6 | 2 Corinthians 5:17 | New Creation |
| 7 | Revelation 21:1-5 | All Things New |

**Pros:**

- Christological from Day 1 (aligns with EUONGELION's "Christ connection" requirement)
- Shows how OT points to Christ and NT flows from Christ
- Unique approach - differentiator for EUONGELION
- Never far from Jesus

**Cons:**

- Non-traditional (may confuse users expecting Genesis-to-Revelation)
- Complex to design well
- Story doesn't unfold naturally
- Hard to market as "through the Bible"

**Audience Fit:** Excellent for Christians who want to see Jesus everywhere. May frustrate those wanting traditional coverage.

**Difficulty to Create:** Very High (requires sophisticated theological mapping)

---

### OPTION E: M'Cheyne-Style (Multiple Daily Readings)

**Description:** Read from OT history, OT poetry/prophets, Gospels, and Epistles each day. Robert Murray M'Cheyne's 1842 plan covers the OT once and NT/Psalms twice yearly.

**Sample Day (Day 45):**
| Reading | Passage | Theme |
|---------|---------|-------|
| OT Narrative | Exodus 24:1-18 | Covenant Confirmed |
| Poetry/Prophets | Psalm 45 | Royal Wedding Psalm |
| Gospel | Mark 10:32-52 | Blind Bartimaeus |
| Epistle | Romans 5:1-11 | Peace with God |

**Pros:**

- Proven approach (180+ years of use)
- Variety every day
- Cross-Testament connections naturally emerge
- Never stuck in one section

**Cons:**

- **CRITICAL PROBLEM:** EUONGELION's Deep Dive format is ONE 4,000-word essay. Four readings = what gets the deep dive?
- Users must track four places in Scripture
- Connections may feel forced
- Doesn't tell the story linearly

**Audience Fit:** Good for disciplined readers with time. Poor for casual readers.

**Difficulty to Create:** Low (M'Cheyne plan is public domain), but HIGH integration challenge with Deep Dive format.

---

### OPTION F: Narrative Arc (Key Story Passages)

**Description:** Select ~365 key passages that carry the narrative, skipping sections that don't advance the story.

**Sample Week (Week 22 - Kingdom Divided):**
| Day | Passage | Theme |
|-----|---------|-------|
| 148 | 1 Kings 11:1-13 | Solomon's Fall |
| 149 | 1 Kings 12:1-24 | Rehoboam's Folly |
| 150 | 1 Kings 16:29-34 | Ahab's Evil |
| 151 | 1 Kings 18:1-19 | Elijah's Challenge |
| 152 | 1 Kings 18:20-40 | Mount Carmel |
| 153 | 1 Kings 19:1-18 | Still Small Voice |
| 154 | 2 Kings 2:1-14 | Elijah Taken Up |

**Pros:**

- Maintains engagement throughout the year
- Every passage is compelling enough for a Deep Dive
- Hits all the "famous" passages people expect
- Story unfolds naturally

**Cons:**

- Skips significant sections (most of Chronicles, some minor prophets, parts of epistles)
- Not truly "through the Bible"
- Users may feel they're missing something
- Harder to defend theologically ("all Scripture is God-breathed")

**Audience Fit:** Excellent for new believers and those who've never read the Bible. May disappoint serious students.

**Difficulty to Create:** Medium (requires curation judgment)

---

## 3. Pacing Options

### OPTION 3A: 365 Days Straight (7 days/week)

**Structure:** Day 1 to Day 365, no breaks.

**Pros:**

- Simple mental model
- Maximum content coverage
- Users always know where they are

**Cons:**

- No rest (contradicts EUONGELION's Sabbath emphasis?)
- Missing a day = behind forever
- Burnout risk

---

### OPTION 3B: 52 Weeks with Sabbath Rest (6 days reading + 1 rest)

**Structure:** 6 days of new content, 7th day for catch-up, reflection, or rest. 312 devotionals + 52 rest days.

**Sample Week:**
| Day | Content |
|-----|---------|
| Mon | Devotional 1 |
| Tue | Devotional 2 |
| Wed | Devotional 3 |
| Thu | Devotional 4 |
| Fri | Devotional 5 |
| Sat | Devotional 6 |
| Sun | Rest/Reflect/Catch-up |

**Pros:**

- Built-in grace for missed days
- Models Sabbath rhythm
- Aligns with "The Sabbath Gift" series philosophy
- Weekly reflection deepens learning

**Cons:**

- Only covers 312 passages (not 365)
- Some users will want content every day
- Complicates "365-day" marketing

---

### OPTION 3C: 5 Days Reading + 2 Days Reflection

**Structure:** Weekday content, weekend reflection. 260 devotionals + 104 reflection days.

**Sample Week:**
| Day | Content |
|-----|---------|
| Mon | Devotional 1 (new) |
| Tue | Devotional 2 (new) |
| Wed | Devotional 3 (new) |
| Thu | Devotional 4 (new) |
| Fri | Devotional 5 (new) |
| Sat | Week Review & Journaling Prompts |
| Sun | Sabbath Rest & Corporate Worship Focus |

**Pros:**

- Realistic for working people
- Two recovery days
- Weekend content could be shorter (summaries, not Deep Dives)

**Cons:**

- Only 260 primary devotionals
- Weekend content feels like "filler"
- Breaks narrative momentum

---

### RECOMMENDATION: Option 3B - 6+1 Rhythm

**Reasoning:**

- Honors the Sabbath principle EUONGELION teaches
- Provides grace for real life
- 312 passages is still substantial
- Sunday reflection could include weekly summary, journaling prompts, and a breath prayer
- Marketing: "One Year Through the Bible" still works; "with built-in Sabbath rest" is a selling point

---

## 4. Starting Point Options

### OPTION 4A: January 1 (Calendar Year)

**Pros:**

- Familiar "New Year's resolution" timing
- Easy to market ("Start fresh in 2027!")
- Users are in sync for community discussion

**Cons:**

- Requires waiting until January
- Users who join mid-year feel behind
- Heavy competition for New Year content

---

### OPTION 4B: Any Monday (Rolling Enrollment)

**Pros:**

- Users can start immediately
- Always "Week 1" for new users
- Personal journey, not calendar-bound

**Cons:**

- No community sync
- Harder to do seasonal content (Christmas passages in July?)
- "Day 127" is meaningless to new users

---

### OPTION 4C: Easter Alignment

**Structure:** Start the Sunday after Easter; year builds toward Good Friday/Easter climax.

**Pros:**

- Culminates in Passion Week (most powerful passages)
- Resurrection ending is dramatic
- Aligns with liturgical calendar

**Cons:**

- Easter moves (March 22 - April 25 range)
- Users must wait for Easter to begin
- Cross-year accounting complexity

---

### OPTION 4D: Hybrid (Fixed Start Dates + Rolling)

**Structure:** Official "cohorts" start January 1, Easter, and September 1 (back-to-school), but users can also start any Monday.

**Pros:**

- Best of both worlds
- Community cohorts for those who want them
- Flexibility for those who don't

**Cons:**

- Multiple cohorts to manage
- Seasonal content still a challenge

---

### RECOMMENDATION: Option 4D - Hybrid

**Reasoning:**

- Three major launch windows capture natural starting points
- Rolling enrollment captures everyone else
- Community features can be cohort-based while content remains accessible anytime
- MVP could launch with rolling only, add cohorts later

---

## 5. Draft Plan Outlines

Based on the above analysis, the two most EUONGELION-aligned options are:

- **Option A: Chronological** (strong narrative, slight complexity)
- **Option F: Narrative Arc** (curated highlights, high engagement)

Below are week-by-week outlines for both.

---

### DRAFT PLAN 1: Chronological (312 readings + 52 rest days)

#### Overview by Movement

| Weeks | Movement                   | Days | Key Events                                   |
| ----- | -------------------------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1-10  | CREATION TO ABRAHAM        | 60   | Creation, Fall, Flood, Babel, Abraham's Call |
| 11-18 | PATRIARCHS                 | 48   | Isaac, Jacob, Joseph                         |
| 19-26 | EXODUS & WILDERNESS        | 48   | Egypt, Plagues, Red Sea, Sinai, Wandering    |
| 27-32 | CONQUEST & JUDGES          | 36   | Joshua, Judges, Ruth                         |
| 33-38 | UNITED KINGDOM             | 36   | Samuel, Saul, David, Solomon                 |
| 39-44 | DIVIDED KINGDOM & PROPHETS | 36   | Elijah, Elisha, Isaiah, etc.                 |
| 45-48 | EXILE                      | 24   | Fall of Israel/Judah, Daniel, Ezekiel        |
| 49-52 | RETURN & WAITING           | 24   | Ezra, Nehemiah, Malachi, Intertestamental    |

**SUBTOTAL: 312 OT readings**

Wait - this doesn't include the New Testament, which per DEVOTIONAL-STRATEGY.md should be **100 days for Gospels** and **85 days for Acts-Revelation**.

Let me recalculate with the recommended distribution from the strategy doc:

#### Revised Distribution (Strategy-Aligned)

| Section             | Days    | Weeks (~6 days/week) |
| ------------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| Genesis-Deuteronomy | 60      | 10                   |
| Joshua-Esther       | 40      | 6.7                  |
| Job-Song of Solomon | 30      | 5                    |
| Prophets            | 50      | 8.3                  |
| **OT Subtotal**     | **180** | **30**               |
| Gospels             | 100     | 16.7                 |
| Acts-Revelation     | 85      | 14.2                 |
| **NT Subtotal**     | **185** | **31**               |
| **TOTAL**           | **365** | **~61 weeks**        |

**Problem:** 365 days / 6 days per week = 60.8 weeks. But a year only has 52 weeks.

**Solution:** Either use 7-day weeks (no rest), OR accept that the "365 devotionals" will take 60+ weeks to complete at a 6-day pace.

**Alternative:** Create 312 devotionals (52 weeks x 6 days) that cover the essential narrative.

---

### Revised Distribution: 312 Devotionals (6 days x 52 weeks)

| Section             | Days    | Weeks   |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Genesis-Deuteronomy | 50      | 8-9     |
| Joshua-Esther       | 32      | 5-6     |
| Job-Song of Solomon | 24      | 4       |
| Prophets            | 40      | 6-7     |
| **OT Subtotal**     | **146** | **~24** |
| Gospels             | 96      | 16      |
| Acts-Revelation     | 70      | 12      |
| **NT Subtotal**     | **166** | **~28** |
| **TOTAL**           | **312** | **52**  |

### DRAFT PLAN 2: Narrative Arc Outline (312 readings)

This plan selects the most compelling passages that carry the biblical story, ensuring every day is "Deep Dive worthy."

#### Selection Criteria

1. **Does it advance the meta-story?** (Creation, Fall, Promise, Exodus, Kingdom, Exile, Incarnation, Passion, Church, Consummation)
2. **Is it compelling enough for 4,000 words?** (Rich in Hebrew/Greek, stories, theological depth)
3. **Does it connect to Christ?** (Type, shadow, prophecy, or direct)
4. **Will readers remember it?** (Cultural resonance, quotability)

## 6. Integration with Deep Dive Format

### The Central Question

> How does a daily Bible reading plan work with 4,000-word narrative essays?

The Deep Dive format per DEVOTIONAL-STRATEGY.md includes:

- Meta-story placement
- PaRDeS structure (4 levels)
- Hebrew/Greek deep-dive (2-3 words)
- Modern story
- Interactive element
- Christ connection
- Reflection questions

### OPTION 6A: Single Passage, Fully Explored

**Structure:** Each day focuses on ONE passage (5-25 verses), explored through all Deep Dive elements.

**Example:** Day 18 - Genesis 22:1-19 (Binding of Isaac)

- **Meta-story:** "We're in the PROMISE era. God tests the promise."
- **Hebrew:** "hineni" (here I am), "yirah" (fear/see/provide), "olah" (burnt offering)
- **Modern story:** A parent's impossible choice
- **PaRDeS:** Literal (Abraham's test), Hint (Isaac = Christ type), Search (Hebrews 11 connection), Secret (the ram/substitute)
- **Interactive:** Breath prayer: "Here I am, Lord"

**Pros:**

- Clean, focused
- One passage = one immersive experience
- Easiest to write/generate

**Cons:**

- 4,000 words on 10 verses can feel stretched
- Some passages aren't "deep dive worthy"

---

### OPTION 6B: Primary Passage + Supporting Texts

**Structure:** Each day has a PRIMARY passage (Deep Dive focus) plus 2-3 SUPPORTING texts that illuminate it.

**Example:** Day 18 - The Binding of Isaac

- **Primary:** Genesis 22:1-19
- **Supporting:** Hebrews 11:17-19, Romans 8:32, John 3:16
- **Deep Dive:** Focuses on Genesis 22 but weaves in NT fulfillment

**Pros:**

- Richer theological connections
- Shows Scripture interpreting Scripture
- More content to work with

**Cons:**

- Readers may feel overwhelmed
- Which passage gets the Hebrew deep-dive?

---

### OPTION 6C: Weekly Theme, Daily Passages

**Structure:** Each WEEK has a theme. Each DAY explores one passage that contributes to that theme. The weekly rest day synthesizes.

**Example:** Week 6 Theme - "The God Who Sees"
| Day | Passage | Angle |
|-----|---------|-------|
| Mon | Genesis 16:1-16 | Hagar: "El Roi" - God who sees |
| Tue | Genesis 21:8-21 | Hagar again: provision in wilderness |
| Wed | Genesis 22:1-19 | Abraham: "Yahweh Yireh" - God will provide |
| Thu | Exodus 2:23-25 | Israel: God saw, God heard, God knew |
| Fri | Psalm 139:1-18 | David: You have searched me and known me |
| Sat | Matthew 6:25-34 | Jesus: Your Father knows what you need |
| Sun | **Weekly Synthesis** | Shorter piece connecting all six |

**Pros:**

- Thematic unity creates memorability
- Daily pieces can be shorter (3,000 words)
- Weekly synthesis ties it together

**Cons:**

- Loses pure chronological/canonical flow
- Requires complex planning
- 7 pieces per week instead of 6

---

### RECOMMENDATION: Option 6A with 6B Flexibility

**Reasoning:**

- Most days: Single passage, fully explored (clean, focused)
- Some days: Primary + supporting when the NT parallel is too important to skip
- This matches the Genesis sample devotional approach (focused passage with NT connections woven in)

**Practical Rule:** If writing Genesis 22, you MUST mention Hebrews 11:17-19 and Romans 8:32. They're not "supporting texts" - they're the culmination of the story.

## 7. Open Questions for Founder

### CRITICAL DECISIONS NEEDED

1. **Reading Plan Philosophy**
   - [ ] Philosophy A: Complete Bible (every verse)
   - [ ] Philosophy B: Whole Story (narrative arc, ~365 key passages)
   - [ ] Philosophy C: Essential Bible (150-200 core passages, spiral)

   **My recommendation:** Philosophy B

2. **Plan Structure**
   - [ ] Option A: Chronological
   - [ ] Option B: Canonical (Genesis-Revelation)
   - [ ] Option C: Thematic
   - [ ] Option D: Gospel-Centered Spiral
   - [ ] Option E: M'Cheyne-style (multiple readings)
   - [ ] Option F: Narrative Arc (curated highlights)

   **My recommendation:** Option A (Chronological) OR Option F (Narrative Arc)

3. **Number of Devotionals**
   - [ ] 365 (requires 7-day weeks, no rest)
   - [ ] 312 (6-day weeks + Sabbath rest)
   - [ ] 260 (5-day weeks + weekend reflection)

   **My recommendation:** 312 (6+1 rhythm)

4. **Starting Point**
   - [ ] January 1 only
   - [ ] Any Monday (rolling)
   - [ ] Liturgical (Easter-aligned)
   - [ ] Hybrid (cohorts + rolling)

   **My recommendation:** Hybrid (start with rolling for MVP)

5. **Deep Dive Integration**
   - [ ] Option 6A: Single passage, fully explored
   - [ ] Option 6B: Primary + supporting texts
   - [ ] Option 6C: Weekly theme, daily passages

   **My recommendation:** Option 6A with flexibility

6. **OT/NT Balance**
   - The strategy doc suggests: OT 180 days, NT 185 days
   - Is this still the desired ratio?
   - Should Gospels really be 100 days (27% of content)?

7. **Wisdom Literature Placement**
   - Chronological: Scatter Psalms throughout historical context
   - Canonical: Group together after history
   - Hybrid: Core Psalms in context, wisdom books grouped

   **What's your preference?**

8. **Minor Prophets**
   - Include all 12 (at least 1 day each)?
   - Focus on the "greatest hits" (Jonah, Micah, Habakkuk)?
   - Weave them into their historical context (chronological)?

9. **Production Sequence**
   - Generate in chronological order (Day 1 first)?
   - Generate "hardest" passages first (test the format)?
   - Generate "most popular" passages first (launch content)?

10. **Existing Content Integration**
    - The 19 existing series (110 days) - do any of these become PART of the Through-the-Bible series?
    - Or do they remain separate "branches"?
