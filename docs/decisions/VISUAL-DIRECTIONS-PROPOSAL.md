# EUONGELION: Three Visual Directions

> **Status:** REQUIRES FOUNDER DECISION
> **Date:** January 18, 2026
> **Purpose:** Present 3 distinct visual approaches for art direction

---

## Context

This document presents three distinct visual directions for EUONGELION imagery. Each direction is rooted in your brand DNA ("Ancient depth, modern clarity") but expresses it differently. These are not templates—they're aesthetic philosophies that would guide all image creation.

**Your stated preferences to honor:**

- Photo + illustration hybrid with dithered treatment interests you
- Limited color palettes (2-4 colors max)
- Anonymous/contextual people (silhouettes, hands, partial figures)
- Magazine-style editorial approach
- AI-generated with prescribed styles
- NOT generic stock imagery

---

## DIRECTION A: Sacred Chiaroscuro

### Philosophy

**"Light breaking into darkness."**

This direction draws from the Baroque masters—Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Georges de La Tour. Single-source dramatic lighting. Figures emerging from darkness. The visual language of mystery and revelation.

This is the most "classical" direction, but executed with modern restraint. Not overwrought religious art—contemplative darkness punctured by meaning.

### Visual DNA

| Element | Treatment                                                   |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light   | Single source, raking, theatrical                           |
| Shadow  | Deep, enveloping, purposeful                                |
| Color   | Desaturated base, warm highlights (candlelight, gold)       |
| Figures | Anonymous silhouettes in light, hands catching illumination |
| Texture | Film grain, subtle noise, soft vignette                     |

### Reference Artists

- **Caravaggio** — The Calling of Saint Matthew, Supper at Emmaus
- **Georges de La Tour** — Magdalene with Smoking Flame, Job Mocked by His Wife
- **Rembrandt** — Return of the Prodigal Son, philosopher studies
- **Bill Viola** (video artist) — slow-motion figures in water and light
- **Gregory Crewdson** (photographer) — theatrical lighting in ordinary spaces

### Modern Execution

- Not literal religious paintings
- Contemporary subjects in classical lighting
- A person reading by single lamplight
- Hands breaking bread, lit from one side
- A silhouette at a window, morning light breaking
- Empty chairs, one illuminated

### Color Approach

```
Primary: Tehom (#1A1612) — the darkness
Accent: Gold (#C19A6B) — the light source
Support: Scroll (#F7F3ED) — where light touches
```

Essentially: **black and gold**. Warm light emerging from deep darkness.

### Best For

- Contemplative content
- Lenten/penitential seasons
- Confession, repentance themes
- Sabbath and rest
- "God in the darkness" narratives

### AI Generation Cues

```
"Caravaggio-style chiaroscuro lighting, single source warm light,
deep shadows, anonymous figure, contemplative, film grain,
desaturated except warm highlights, museum quality,
not religious kitsch, modern interpretation of baroque"
```

### Search Terms (Pinterest/Dribbble)

- "Chiaroscuro photography"
- "Baroque contemporary art"
- "Single source dramatic lighting"
- "Bill Viola video stills"
- "Theatrical portrait lighting"

## DIRECTION B: Textured Minimalism

### Philosophy

**"Quiet presence. Earned emptiness."**

This direction draws from Japanese aesthetics (ma—the meaningful pause), Kinfolk magazine, and contemplative photography. Space is not absence but presence. Objects and figures exist in relationship to emptiness.

This is the most restrained direction. Whisper, not shout. The visual language of Sabbath, of breathing room.

### Visual DNA

| Element     | Treatment                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Composition | Asymmetric, generous negative space               |
| Color       | Muted earth tones, near-monochrome                |
| Texture     | Natural materials—linen, stone, paper, wood grain |
| Figures     | Partial, gestural—a hand, a shoulder, turned away |
| Light       | Soft, diffused, overcast or window light          |

### Reference Artists

- **Hiroshi Sugimoto** — Seascapes (minimal horizon lines)
- **Todd Hido** — Interiors with soft light, loneliness without despair
- **Nadav Kander** — Portraits with space, muted palette
- **Michael Kenna** — Minimal landscapes, long exposure serenity
- **Cereal Magazine** — Editorial restraint, intentional emptiness

### Modern Execution

- A linen cloth, corner of bread, wine glass edge—not the full table
- Hands in lap, out of focus face
- An open book, morning light, nothing else
- Architectural negative space—doorway, window, corridor
- Natural textures filling the frame—stone wall, water surface

### Color Approach

```
Primary: Scroll (#F7F3ED) — dominant, spacious
Support: Warm grays, taupes, soft browns
Accent: Gethsemane Olive (#6B6B4F) — organic warmth
Optional: Shalom Blue (#4A5F6B) — for cool contemplation
```

Essentially: **earth and air**. The palette of natural materials at rest.

### Best For

- Sabbath devotionals
- Rest and solitude themes
- Listening/silence content
- Prayer and meditation
- Gentle conviction (not harsh)

### AI Generation Cues

```
"Kinfolk magazine aesthetic, generous negative space,
muted earth tones, soft natural light, partial figure,
natural textures, minimal composition, contemplative,
quiet presence, Japanese ma concept, editorial restraint"
```

### Search Terms (Pinterest/Dribbble)

- "Kinfolk magazine photography"
- "Ma Japanese aesthetics"
- "Negative space editorial"
- "Wabi-sabi photography"
- "Minimal still life"

## DIRECTION C: Risograph Sacred

### Philosophy

**"Ancient texts through the xerox machine."**

This direction takes your stated interest in dithered/digital art and grounds it in meaning. The risograph/screenprint aesthetic carries weight: it evokes zines, protest posters, independent publishing—words and images reproduced urgently, imperfectly.

Apply this to sacred content and you get something provocative: the Gospel as underground literature. Scripture as samizdat. Faith as counter-cultural document.

### Visual DNA

| Element     | Treatment                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Texture     | Dithered, halftone dots, risograph grain            |
| Color       | Limited palette (2-3 colors), often duotone         |
| Composition | Bold, graphic, poster-like                          |
| Figures     | Stylized, can be more visible than other directions |
| Typography  | Integrated, part of the image, not overlay          |

### Reference Artists

- **Risograph printers** — Hato Press, Perfectly Acceptable, Colour Code
- **Gig posters** — Aesthetic of hand-printed urgency
- **Makoto Fujimura** — not risograph but _layered texture_, depth through repetition
- **Shepard Fairey** — graphic power, limited palette (without the propaganda feel)
- **Experimental typography** — Emigre magazine, David Carson's deconstructed layouts

### Modern Execution

- Photo of hands folded in prayer, dithered into two-color print
- Biblical scene illustrated in screenprint style
- Typography woven into image—verse becoming visual
- Layered textures: photo base + halftone treatment + grain
- Mixed media: photography with illustrated overlays

### Color Approach

```
Option A: Tehom + Gold (darkness and light, duotone)
Option B: Covenant Burgundy + Scroll (blood and parchment)
Option C: Shalom Blue + Scroll (water and sky)
Option D: Black + single accent color per piece
```

Essentially: **high contrast, limited palette**. Each piece commits to 2-3 colors maximum.

### Best For

- Bold proclamation content
- Doctrinal/theological teaching
- Prophetic/justice themes
- Series branding and thumbnails
- Social media graphics
- "The Gospel is radical" messaging

### AI Generation Cues

```
"Risograph print aesthetic, limited color palette, halftone dots,
dithered texture, graphic poster style, screenprint quality,
bold composition, integrated typography, underground press feel,
not polished, intentionally textured, sacred zine aesthetic"
```

- "Halftone portrait"
- "Screenprint poster design"
- "Dithered digital art"

## Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

Based on your stated preferences, I recommend **using all three directions contextually**:

```
CONTENT TYPE          → VISUAL DIRECTION
─────────────────────────────────────────
Contemplative/Rest    → B (Textured Minimalism)
Teaching/Exposition   → A (Sacred Chiaroscuro)
Bold proclamation     → C (Risograph Sacred)
Sabbath devotionals   → B (Textured Minimalism)
Series branding       → C (Risograph Sacred)
Narrative/Story       → A (Sacred Chiaroscuro)
Social graphics       → C (Risograph Sacred)
```

This matches your feedback that mood should vary with content: "Contemplative AND Bold/Dramatic" depending on context.

**The unifying elements across all three:**

1. Limited color palettes (never full spectrum)
2. Anonymous/contextual human presence
3. Intentional texture (grain, noise, or pattern)
4. Editorial quality (magazine, not stock)
5. AI-generated with specific style prescriptions

---

## Your Decision

**Option 1:** Commit to ONE direction for brand consistency

- Pick A, B, or C as the primary visual language
- Other directions used only as exceptions

**Option 2:** Hybrid system as recommended above

- Content type determines visual direction
- Unified by palette, texture, and human treatment

**Option 3:** Refine further

- Create samples in each direction first
- Decide after seeing actual executions

---

## Next Steps If Approved

1. **Create sample images** in chosen direction(s)
   - You mentioned making samples for the dithered treatment
   - I can provide detailed AI prompts for each

2. **Document the precise treatment**
   - Filters, effects, post-processing steps
   - Create a "recipe" for consistency

3. **Build prompt library**
   - AI generation prompts by content type
   - Reference image collection for each direction

4. **Create 3-5 hero images**
   - Test the direction at scale
   - Refine based on what works
