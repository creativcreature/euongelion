## The Vision

**People seeking God daily. Communities transforming because of it.**

## Our Posture

We are sowers of seeds — spreading the gospel unapologetically while meeting people where they are.

We plant. We water. God gives the growth.

Some seeds land on rocky ground. Some get choked by thorns. Some bear fruit — thirty, sixty, a hundredfold. That's not ours to control.

Our job is to sow faithfully and trust.

## Mission vs. Vision

| **Mission** (what we do)       | Shepherd God's flock to Jesus. Find the lost sheep. Help them find their way back home — to their relationship with God. |
| **Vision** (where we're going) | People seeking God daily. Communities transforming because of it.                                                        |

## What This Means for the Work

Every feature, every design choice, every piece of content should ask:

1. **Are we sowing?** — Does this spread the gospel?
2. **Are we meeting them where they are?** — Is this accessible to the person in front of us?
3. **Are we trusting?** — Or are we trying to manufacture results?

We don't manipulate. We don't water down. We plant seeds and trust God with the harvest.
