# User Personas - Refined

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** January 17, 2026
**Based On:** AUDIENCE.md
**Purpose:** Detailed user profiles to guide product decisions

---

## Overview

These four personas represent EUONGELION's primary audience segments. Each persona is designed to be actionable for:

- Content creation (what topics, what tone)
- UX design (what frustrations to avoid, what features matter)
- Marketing (where to reach them, what messaging resonates)
- Product decisions (what to build, what to skip)

**Remember:** These are internal tools. Users never see "Drifted Believer" labels. We meet people as people.

| "I'm too far gone"         | Messaging: "You're not behind. You're here."      |
| "I don't have time"        | Positioning: 15-20 min is substantial but doable  |
| "Church hurt me"           | Tone: Warm, non-judgmental, no guilt trips        |
| "This will be superficial" | Proof: Show the depth, word studies, real content |

### A Day in Sarah's Life

**10:30 PM:** Finally asleep.

**EUONGELION Entry Point:** The 9:30 PM window. That moment of quiet reflection before sleep. Or the 8:30 AM commute. Content that speaks to the "is this all there is?" feeling.

### Photo Description

A couple in their early 50s, photographed in their comfortable home. They look kind and reliable, dressed casually. They're the people you'd ask to watch your house when you're on vacation. There's a warmth to them but also a weariness—the look of people who've done the right thing for so long they've forgotten why. A Bible is visible on the coffee table, but it looks untouched.

### The Quote

- Prayer life has become routine
- Bible reading is check-the-box
- Knows they should feel more but don't
- Wonders if this spiritual dryness is just "what happens at this age"

| "This is probably for new believers" | Positioning: "Depth for the serious seeker"      |
| "I don't need another devotional"    | Differentiate from greeting-card devotionals     |

A man in his late 40s, photographed in a church office or study. Bookcases filled with theology books behind him. He's dressed in business casual (button-down, no tie).

- Prayer life is often about the congregation, rarely personal
- Doesn't have peers to be vulnerable with
- Wife may be the only one who knows how depleted they are
- Carries weight of everyone else's crises
- Rarely has time for own spiritual formation

### Pain Points

| Pain                                  | Intensity | Notes                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Depleted from pouring out**         | Very High | Gives constantly, rarely receives     |
| **Loneliness of leadership**          | High      | Can't be vulnerable with congregation |
| **No one shepherds them**             | High      | Expected to have it together          |
| **Own spiritual formation neglected** | High      | Always studying for others            |
| **Imposter syndrome**                 | Medium    | Preaches what they struggle to live   |
| **Burnout**                           | High      | May be considering leaving ministry   |

### Goals

- Personal spiritual feeding (not sermon prep)
- Content that meets them as a person, not just a pastor
- Permission to struggle and be shepherded
- Deeper theological engagement for own growth
- Tools to extend their shepherding (study materials for congregation)
- Community with other leaders who understand

### Objections to Overcome

| Objection                              | Response Strategy                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| "I don't have time"                    | Design for busy schedule; quality over quantity |
| "I already study the Bible all day"    | This is different—for you, not your sermon      |
| "My congregation might see"            | Private experience, no social features          |
| "This isn't theologically deep enough" | Demonstrate depth meets seminary level          |
| "I should be past needing this"        | Normalize: shepherds need shepherding           |

### Journey Triggers

**What brings Pastor James to EUONGELION:**

- Trusted pastoral peer recommends it
- Sees it mentioned at conference
- Spouse finds it and shares
- Searching "spiritual formation for pastors"
- At a breaking point, searching for anything

### A Day in Pastor James's Life

**5:30 AM:** Up before family. Attempts prayer. Often interrupted by mental to-do list.

**6:00 AM:** Study for Sunday sermon. Commentaries. Original languages.

**7:00 AM:** Family wakes. Breakfast. Kids to school.

**8:30 AM:** Office. Staff meeting. Planning. Emails (so many emails).

**10:00 AM - 12:00 PM:** Counseling sessions. Marriage in crisis. Member in hospital. Family grieving.

**12:30 PM:** Lunch at desk. Catches up on administration.

**1:30 PM - 5:00 PM:** More meetings. Elder board prep. Budget review. Building issues.

**5:30 PM:** Home for dinner. Tries to be present with family.

**7:00 PM:** Kids' activities or evening meeting (small group, visitation, committee).

**9:30 PM:** Finally quiet. Exhausted. Tries to read but falls asleep.

**EUONGELION Entry Point:** The 5:30 AM slot—but not for sermon prep. For him. Or the rare Saturday afternoon. Content that feeds the feeder.
