## The Posture

We are sowers of seeds. We plant, we water, God gives the growth.

Metrics help us understand if seeds are taking root — not to manufacture results, but to sow more faithfully.

---

## Metrics Framework

### 1. Seeds Planted (Reach)

_Are we getting in front of people?_

| Metric                | What It Tells Us         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| New visitors          | People finding us        |
| Soul Audits completed | People engaging honestly |
| First series started  | Seeds in the ground      |

---

### 2. Seeds Taking Root (Resonance)

_Is the content landing?_

| Metric                | What It Tells Us          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Series completions    | They stayed through Day 5 |
| Return within 7 days  | It pulled them back       |
| Second series started | They wanted more          |

---

### 3. Growth (Steadfastness)

_Is this becoming a rhythm?_

| Metric                      | What It Tells Us                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Return visits over 30+ days | Sustained seeking                 |
| 3+ series completed         | Going deeper                      |
| Account created             | Committed enough to save progress |

**This is the primary success metric.** If steadfastness grows, we're doing our job.

---

### 4. Fruit (Multiplication)

_Are they sharing the harvest?_

| Metric                     | What It Tells Us     |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Share button clicks        | Intent to spread     |
| Visits from shared links   | Actually spreading   |
| Series started from shares | Seeds planting seeds |

---

## Thresholds (What "Good" Looks Like)

| Indicator    | Threshold                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Engaged      | Returns 3+ times in a month                  |
| Steadfast    | Returns consistently over 30+ days           |
| Going deeper | Completes 2+ series                          |
| Multiplying  | Shares and that share converts to a new user |

These are not goals to optimize. They're signals that help us understand what's happening.

## What We Don't Measure

| Metric                    | Why We Skip It                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Time on page              | Guilt-inducing, not meaningful |
| Streak counts             | Manipulation, not devotion     |
| Daily active users (DAU)  | Vanity metric                  |
| Scroll depth              | Surveillance, not insight      |
| Notifications sent/opened | Pressure tactics               |

We will never use metrics to guilt, pressure, or manipulate.

---

## What We Can't Measure (And How We'll Learn)

| We Can't See                 | Phase 2 Solution                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| If their life changed        | Invite testimonies                 |
| If they prayed               | — (not ours to see)                |
| If communities transformed   | Collect and share stories of faith |
| If they reconciled or served | — (fruit we trust God with)        |

**Testimonies (Phase 2):** Invite users to share their story. With permission, share these as "Stories of Faith" — not marketing testimonials, but real accounts of transformation.

---

## Honest Accounting

We sow. We measure what we can. We trust God with the rest.

Good metrics tell us if we're sowing faithfully — reaching people, resonating, seeing steadfastness. They don't tell us the full story, and that's okay.

The harvest belongs to God.
