## Overview

This document provides ready-to-use copy for EUONGELION's user-facing experience. Every phrase here has been crafted to meet people where they are without categorizing them, to be honest without being harsh, and to invite without manipulating.

**Core Principle:** Users should feel _met_, not _sorted_.

---

## 1. Replacing Pathway Labels

### The Problem

Internally, we use Sleep/Awake/Shepherd to categorize content. Users should never see these labels or feel like they've been put in a box.

### The Solution: Self-Identification Through Questions

Instead of labeling users, we invite them to describe _their own_ experience. The Soul Audit does this through open-ended reflection, but even before that, we can use language that lets people see themselves.

#### Landing Page Self-Identification Options

**Option A: The Honest Question Approach**

Instead of asking "Which pathway are you?" we present descriptions that resonate:

> **Where are you right now?**
>
> "I used to believe. I'm not sure what I believe anymore."
>
> "I believe. I just feel... stuck."
>
> "I lead others. But nobody leads me."

_Note: These are NOT pathway selections. They're echoes of what our audience already feels. They lead to the same Soul Audit regardless._

---

**Option B: The Open Door Approach**

No self-identification at entry. Simply:

> **Something brought you here.**
>
> Maybe it's been a while since you thought about God.
> Maybe you think about Him all the time and feel nothing.
> Maybe you're tired.
>
> Whatever it is, you're welcome here.

---

**Option C: The Daily Reality Approach**

> **You probably weren't looking for another app.**
>
> But maybe you've been looking for something.
> A moment. A word. A reason to slow down.
>
> This is a place to start.

---

### Language That Replaces Labels

| Instead of...                 | We say...                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| "You're in the Sleep pathway" | "We'll start with some grounding"           |
| "Sleep content"               | "Content for fresh eyes"                    |
| "Awake pathway"               | "Going deeper"                              |
| "Awake content"               | "Content that challenges comfortable faith" |
| "Shepherd pathway"            | "For those who lead"                        |
| "Shepherd content"            | "Dense material for study and teaching"     |

### Post-Audit Framing (What Users Actually See)

After Soul Audit, users see their matched content. Here's how we frame it:

**NOT:** "Based on your answers, you're in the Sleep pathway."

**YES:**

> **We heard you.**
>
> Based on what you shared, we've selected content that speaks to where you are right now. This isn't a permanent category. It's a starting point.

Or, even simpler:

> **Here's where we'll start.**
>
> You can always explore other series. But we think this one will meet you well.

---

## 2. Soul Audit Framing

### Primary Prompt

"What are you wrestling with today?"

### Why This Works

- **Biblical resonance:** Jacob wrestling with God at Jabbok (Genesis 32) — struggle that leads to blessing and new identity
- **Universally understood:** Everyone knows what "wrestling" feels like, even without the biblical reference
- **Present tense:** "Today" makes it immediate, not abstract
- **Active, not passive:** "Wrestling" implies engagement, not just suffering
- **Cheeky but honest:** Feels real, not churchy

**Subtext (smaller, below):**
"You don't have to have it figured out. Just start writing."

**Placeholder text:**
"Lately, I've been..."

---

#### Alternative Option A: Softer Entry

**Main prompt:** "What's on your mind lately?"

**Subtext:**
"This helps us find content that fits where you are."

**Placeholder:**
"Lately, I've been..."

_Pro:_ Less presumptuous. Con: Slightly less specific.\*

---

#### Alternative Option B: Direct and Honest

**Main prompt:** "What brought you here?"

**Subtext:**
"Be as honest as you want. No one but you will see this."

**Placeholder:**
"I came here because..."

_Pro: Acknowledges the user's agency. Con: Could feel like a survey question._

---

#### Alternative Option C: Permission-Giving

**Main prompt:** "What's been hard to say out loud?"

**Subtext:**
"This is between you and the page. Write what's real."

**Placeholder:**
"If I'm being honest..."

_Pro: Deeply inviting for those carrying shame. Con: Might be too vulnerable for skeptics._

---

### Validation Messages

**If response is too short (under 20 characters):**

> "Say a little more. Even one sentence helps."

**If response is blank:**

> "Take your time. When you're ready, just write what comes."

---

## 3. Key UI Copy

### Landing Page

#### Headline Options

**Option A (Recommended):**

> **Daily bread for the cluttered, hungry soul.**

**Option B:**

> **Something to hold onto.**

**Option C:**

> **A quiet place to start.**

**Option D:**

> **For those who believe. Or want to. Or used to.**

---

#### Subtext Options

**Pair with Option A:**

> Short daily readings that meet you where you are. No accounts. No tracking. Just content worth your time.

**Pair with Option B:**

> When everything feels like noise, come back to what matters. Daily content for the seeking heart.

**Pair with Option C:**

> Simple devotional content designed for busy, skeptical, hungry people. Start where you are.

**Pair with Option D:**

> Honest content about faith, life, and the hard questions. No performance. No pressure.

---

### What We Call the Experience

**AVOID:**

- "Devotional" (too churchy for some)
- "Spiritual journey" (too generic/new-age)
- "Faith course" (too programmatic)
- "Bible study" (too institutional)

**USE:**

- **"Daily readings"** (neutral, descriptive)
- **"The walk"** (journey metaphor without jargon)
- **"A series"** (content-focused, no religious baggage)
- **"Something to sit with"** (invites reflection)

**In-App Language Examples:**

> "Start a new series" (not "Begin your journey")
>
> "Today's reading" (not "Today's devotional")
>
> "Continue where you left off" (not "Resume your walk with God")

---

### After Soul Audit (Matching Language)

**Header:**

> **We found something for you.**

**Body:**

> Based on what you shared, we selected a series that speaks to where you are. It's not a prescription. It's a starting point.

**CTA Button:**

> "Begin" or "Start Reading"

---

### Day-Gating Messaging

When content is time-locked, we need to explain why without being preachy.

**Locked Day Message (Recommended):**

> **This day isn't ready yet.**
>
> Good things take time. Including you.
> Come back tomorrow. The content will be here.

---

**Alternative A (Warmer):**

> **Not yet.**
>
> This content unlocks tomorrow. In the meantime, sit with today's reading. Let it work.

---

**Alternative B (Direct):**

> **Day [X] unlocks tomorrow.**
>
> We pace these readings intentionally. Rush through and you miss the point.

---

**Alternative C (Grace-filled):**

> **You're ahead of schedule.**
>
> Take a breath. Today's content is still worth your attention.

---

### Completion Messaging

**End of Day:**

> **Done for today.**
>
> That's enough. Let it settle.
>
> [Tomorrow: Day X unlocks at midnight]

---

**End of Series:**

> **You finished.**
>
> [Series Name] is complete. But the questions it raised aren't meant to be answered in five days.
>
> What's next? Another series, or just some silence.

**CTA Options:**

> "Find Another Series" / "Sit With This" / "Share With Someone"

---

**Share Prompt:**

> **Know someone who needs this?**
>
> No pressure. But if this helped, it might help them too.

---

### Empty States

**No series started:**

> **Nothing here yet.**
>
> Start with something short. Five days. See how it feels.

---

**All series completed:**

> **You've been through everything.**
>
> More is coming. Until then, revisit what spoke to you most.

---

### Error Messages

**Session expired:**

> **Your session ended.**
>
> That's okay. Let's start fresh.
> [Begin Again]

---

**Connection lost:**

> **We lost the connection.**
>
> Check your signal and try again. Your progress is saved.

---

**Something went wrong:**

> **Something broke.**
>
> It's not you. We're working on it.
> [Try Again] or [Report Issue]

---

## 4. Tone Calibration

### The Voice We're Aiming For

**Warm but not saccharine:**

> "You're welcome here, mess and all." NOT "We're SO excited to have you on this AMAZING journey!"

**Honest but not harsh:**

> "This might challenge what you've assumed." NOT "Most Christians are doing it wrong."

**Inviting but not desperate:**

> "Start when you're ready." NOT "Don't miss this life-changing opportunity!"

**Intelligent but not academic:**

> "The Hebrew word here is 'hevel'--it means vapor, breath, something you can't hold." NOT "The lexical analysis of hevel in the LXX tradition suggests..."

**Confident but not arrogant:**

> "We've thought carefully about this content." NOT "This is the only way to understand faith."

---

### 5 Example Sentences (Correct Tone)

1. **On difficulty:** "Faith has always been hard to hold. You're not the first to struggle."

2. **On doubt:** "Doubt isn't the opposite of faith. Apathy is. You're here--that means something."

3. **On busy lives:** "You don't have five hours for this. We designed it for five minutes. The content is dense, not long."

4. **On returning after absence:** "You drifted. Most people do. Coming back is the part that takes courage."

5. **On what we offer:** "We don't have all the answers. But we have honest questions and ancient texts that still speak."

---

### Tone Red Flags to Avoid

| DON'T                           | DO                            |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| "On this incredible journey..." | "As you read..."              |
| "God wants you to..."           | "Scripture says..."           |
| "You'll be transformed!"        | "This might shift something." |
| "Join thousands of believers!"  | "Start where you are."        |
| "Unlock your purpose!"          | "Explore what matters."       |
| "We're so blessed to have you!" | "You're welcome here."        |

---

## 5. Specific Copy Blocks (Ready to Use)

### About Page / What This Is

> **EUONGELION is a place to read, reflect, and return to what matters.**
>
> We make honest content for people who believe, used to believe, or want to believe but have questions. No accounts required. No tracking. No pressure to perform.
>
> Each series is five days. One reading per day. Designed to be short enough for busy lives and deep enough to be worth your time.
>
> We don't have all the answers. But the questions are worth asking, and you shouldn't have to ask them alone.

---

### Footer Tagline Options

> "Daily bread for the cluttered, hungry soul."

> "Something to hold onto."

> "Honest content for the seeking heart."

---

### Email Subject Lines (Welcome Sequence)

**Day 0 (Sign-up):**

> "Welcome. Here's what to expect."

**Day 1:**

> "Day 1 is ready."

**Day 3:**

> "Still with us? Good."

**Day 5:**

> "You finished. Now what?"

---

## Implementation Notes

1. **A/B Test:** The landing page headline should be tested. "Daily bread for the cluttered, hungry soul" is the strongest theologically, but "Something to hold onto" may convert better for skeptics.

2. **Localization:** This language is written for American English. Adaptations may be needed for other markets.

3. **Accessibility:** All copy should be checked for readability (aim for 8th-grade level on Flesch-Kincaid for public-facing content, higher for Shepherd-targeted series).

4. **Living Document:** Update this document as we learn from user feedback. The goal is resonance, not perfection.
