The ones who collapse into bed still mentally running through tomorrow's list.                         | Sleep   |
| 2                              | **The God Who Naps**                        | Mark 4:38 - "Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion."                                                                                                                                               | For those who feel guilty about rest, who've made productivity their religion. Jesus slept during a storm. What's your excuse?                                              | Sleep   |
| 3                              | **Margin**                                  | Exodus 20:8 - "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy."                                                                                                                                               | For the over-committed who've squeezed God out of a schedule that was never sustainable. The white space you keep filling is trying to tell you something.                  | Sleep   |
| 4                              | **When Everything Is Urgent**               | Luke 10:41-42 - "Martha, Martha... Mary has chosen what is better."                                                                                                                                        | For those who've mistaken activity for meaning, busyness for importance. When everything is urgent, nothing is.                                                             | Awake   |

What if you're wrong?                                            | Awake   |
| 6                              | **The Unfinished List**                     | Ecclesiastes 3:1 - "There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens."                                                                                                    | For the person who goes to bed with tasks undone and wakes up already behind. Your to-do list will outlive you. Now what?                                                   | Sleep   |
| 7                              | **Never Enough**                            | Psalm 127:2 - "In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat - for he grants sleep to those he loves."                                                                                  | For those whose identity is tangled up in their output, who've made themselves into machines and wonder why they're breaking down.                                          | Awake   |
| 8                              | **Stop**                                    | Psalm 46:10 - "Be still, and know that I am God."                                                                                                                                                          | For the person who hasn't stopped in years. Who feels anxious when nothing demands their attention. The stillness isn't empty. It's full of something you've been avoiding. | Sleep   |
| 9                              | **Addicted to Busy**                        | Proverbs 19:2 - "Desire without knowledge is not good - how much more will hasty feet miss the way!"                                                                                                       | For those who wear exhaustion as a badge of honor. Somewhere along the way, you started confusing motion with meaning.                                                      | Awake   |
| 10                             | **When Doing Nothing Is Everything**        | 1 Kings 19:5-7 - "Then he lay down under the bush and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said, 'Get up and eat.'"                                                                           | For the burned out, the depleted, the ones running on fumes. Even Elijah needed a nap and a snack before he could hear God.                                                 | Sleep   |
| 101                            | **The Guilt of Sitting Still**              | Matthew 11:28 - "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."                                                                                                                | For those who feel anxious when they're not productive. Your worth isn't your output.                                                                                       | Awake   |
| **DOUBT / FAITH**              |                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                             |         |
| 11                             | **Honest to God**                           | Psalm 13:1 - "How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever?"                                                                                                                                                 | For those who've been told doubt is sin but can't shake the questions. The Psalms are full of people yelling at God. You're in good company.                                | Awake   |
| 12                             | **The Faith I Lost**                        | Matthew 17:20 - "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed..."                                                                                                                                          | For the person who used to believe something and now isn't sure. The faith you had wasn't wrong - but maybe it was incomplete.                                              | Sleep   |
| 13                             | **Believing in Doubt**                      | Mark 9:24 - "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"                                                                                                                                                  | For those who feel like frauds because faith feels hard. This is the most honest prayer in the Bible. It might become yours.                                                | Sleep   |
| 14                             | **What If I'm Wrong?**                      | John 20:25 - "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands... I will not believe."                                                                                                                             | For the skeptic who needs evidence but has been told evidence is the enemy of faith. Thomas asked for proof. Jesus showed up.                                               | Awake   |
| 15                             | **The God I Don't Believe In**              | Exodus 3:14 - "I AM WHO I AM."                                                                                                                                                                             | For those who've rejected a version of God worth rejecting. What if the God you walked away from was never the real one?                                                    | Awake   |
| 16                             | **Reconstructing**                          | Isaiah 43:19 - "See, I am doing a new thing!"                                                                                                                                                              | For those in the rubble of deconstruction, wondering if anything can be rebuilt. Tearing down isn't the end. It might be the start.                                         | Awake   |
| 17                             | **Wrestling Match**                         | Genesis 32:26 - "I will not let you go unless you bless me."                                                                                                                                               | For those who won't settle for easy answers. Jacob fought God and walked away with a limp and a new name. Sometimes faith leaves marks.                                     | Awake   |
| 18                             | **Still Here**                              | Hebrews 11:1 - "Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see."                                                                                                       | For the person who thought they'd have left by now but keeps showing up. The fact that you're still asking might be the answer.                                             | Sleep   |
| 19                             | **The Silence of God**                      | Psalm 22:1 - "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"                                                                                                                                                   | For those who've prayed and heard nothing, who wonder if anyone's listening. Jesus quoted this Psalm on the cross. Even he felt it.                                         | Sleep   |
| 20                             | **Unanswered**                              | Habakkuk 1:2 - "How long, Lord, must I call for help, but you do not listen?"                                                                                                                              | For those with prayers that never got answered the way they wanted. Maybe the answer wasn't no. Maybe it was something else entirely.                                       | Awake   |
| 102                            | **Permission to Stop Reading the Bible**    | John 5:39-40 - "You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life." | For those drowning in devotional guilt.

Logic doesn't cure anxiety. But something else might.                                                          | Sleep   |

Pride is lonely. So is independence. The people who love you want to know you're struggling.                                         | Sleep   |

Who expect abandonment. There's a love that isn't conditional on your performance.                                              | Sleep   |

You can grieve what you didn't get and find what you need. Both are true.                                               | Sleep   |

Avoiding conflict doesn't make it go away. It just makes it quieter.                                               | Awake   |

Jesus answered, 'Not seven times, but seventy-seven times.'"                                    | For those holding onto something that's poisoning them slowly. Forgiveness isn't saying it was okay.

The root goes deep. Pulling it up will hurt. Do it anyway.                                     | Awake   |
| 66                             | **The Apology You'll Never Get**            | Genesis 50:20 - "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good."                                                                                                                                   | For those waiting for someone to acknowledge what they did. They might never. Your healing can't depend on their awareness.                                                 | Sleep   |

It doesn't mean trust. It doesn't mean reconciliation. It means release.                                          | Awake   |

Job argued with God for 37 chapters. God showed up and called him righteous.                                                | Sleep   |

Loving your enemy doesn't mean liking them. It means refusing to let them own your soul.                                     | Awake   |

Generational sin is real. So is generational redemption. The cycle can end with you.                               | Awake   |

But it is you, a man like myself, my companion, my close friend."                                                                    | For those wounded by the people who should have been safe. The pain is real. So is healing.                                                                                 | Sleep   |

Grace isn't limited. Your shame thinks it is.                                                         | Sleep   |

Failure might be the most important thing that ever happened to you. Not because it's good - because of what it reveals.            | Awake   |

After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh?"                                                                          | For the perfectionist Christian exhausted by their own effort. You can't earn what you've already been given. Stop trying.                                                  | Awake   |

Jonah was literally in the belly of a fish. God met him there.                                                      | Sleep   |

Peter denied Jesus three times. Jesus asked him back three times.                                             | Sleep   |

Accepting a gift requires admitting you can't pay for it.                                            | Awake   |

The righteous aren't defined by never falling. They're defined by getting up.                                                | Sleep   |

Numbing isn't evil - it's survival. But it's not life.                                             | Sleep   |

Real freedom isn't instant. It's daily. And it's possible.                                                 | Sleep   |

Relapse isn't failure. Giving up is. You're still here.                                                | Sleep   |

God doesn't count your restarts. He just shows up for each one.                                           | Sleep   |

Stopping isn't the point. What you start matters more.                                                                         | Awake   |

Addiction is often the second problem. The first one's still waiting.                                             | Awake   |

| 91                             | **The Ache That Won't Go Away**             | Ecclesiastes 3:11 - "He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end."                                                                          | For those who have everything and still feel empty. The ache isn't broken. It's designed. It's pointing somewhere.                                                          | Sleep   |

Everything is meaningless.'"                                                                                       | For the existentialist, the nihilist, the person who's tried everything and found it empty. The Bible's most depressing book might be its most honest.                      | Awake   |
| 93                             | **Sunday Scaries**                          | Psalm 90:12 - "Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom."                                                                                                                           | For those who dread Monday so much it ruins Sunday. If five-sevenths of your life is something to survive, something's wrong.                                               | Sleep   |
| 94                             | **The Life You Thought You'd Have**         | Jeremiah 29:11 - "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."                                                  | For those mourning a future that never came. The plan you had wasn't the plan. But there's still a plan.                                                                    | Sleep   |

God's first act was hovering over the void. He's not afraid of your darkness.                                          | Sleep   |
