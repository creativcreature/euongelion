It is a battlefield command from the God who makes wars cease and breaks bows in two. Stillness, in this context, is not passivity.

He was calling the driven, the burnt-out, the people who measure their worth by their output.\n\nNotice the sequence: come first, then receive rest. Not earn rest, not schedule rest, not optimize rest. Come. The offer is relational before it is practical. Rest begins with proximity to Jesus, not with a productivity system.",
