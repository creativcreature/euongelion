Fresh, healthy food was almost impossible to find. He got tired of seeing the problem, so he decided to become the solution. He took a neglected strip of dirt between his house and the street—a forgotten, barren piece of public land—and he planted a garden. He planted kale, and sunflowers, and pomegranates, turning a patch of urban blight into an oasis of life.\n\nAt first, he got in trouble. The city cited him for planting without a permit. But Ron Finley fought back. He started a movement, petitioning the city to change its laws. He became known as the \"Gangsta Gardener,\" a rebel with a cause. He wasn't just planting vegetables; he was planting hope. He started teaching kids in the neighborhood how to garden, showing them that they could grow their own food, that they could have a hand in changing their own environment. He was turning a generation of consumers into cultivators.\n\nRon Finley is a modern-day image of what it means to be a co-gardener with God. He saw a desolate space, a \"formless and empty\" patch of his world, and he didn't wait for someone else to fix it. He got his hands dirty. He planted, he watered, he cultivated, and he brought forth life. He took the garden God had given him—a small strip of dirt in South Central L.A.—and he worked it and took care of it, turning it into a place of beauty, nourishment, and community. He was living out the original mandate given to Adam in the Garden of Eden.",
