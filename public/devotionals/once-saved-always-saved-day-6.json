And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of God. Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart."

David had become a different kind of pastor - one who preached with the authority of someone who had wrestled with God and discovered that his love is stronger than our questions. Sarah had found purpose in her work she had never experienced before.\n\n'You know what I've learned?' Sarah said to David. 'The race of faith isn't about running faster or being stronger than other people. It's about endurance - about keeping going when you don't feel like it, when you can't see the finish line, when you're not sure you're even on the right track.'\n\nDavid nodded. 'I used to think that strong faith meant never having questions. But I think real faith is the decision to keep trusting God even when you can't understand what he's doing.'\n\n'Emma taught me something important,' David continued. 'One day when she was really sick from chemo, she said, \"Daddy, I don't understand why I have to be sick, but I know you love me and you're taking care of me.\" That's when I realized that faith isn't about understanding everything - it's about trusting the character of someone who loves you even when you can't figure out what they're doing.'",
