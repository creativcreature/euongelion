      "body": "In the summer of 1941, in the hell of Auschwitz, a prisoner escaped. In retaliation, the camp commandant, Karl Fritzsch, ordered that ten men be chosen to die in a starvation bunker. As the guards pulled men from the ranks, one of them, a Polish sergeant named Franciszek Gajowniczek, cried out, \"My wife! My children!\" He was begging for his life, for the future of his family. At that moment, another prisoner, a man who was not chosen, stepped forward. It was a Catholic priest named Maximilian Kolbe. He walked calmly before the commandant and said, \"I am a Catholic priest. I want to die for that man. I am old; he has a wife and children.\"\n\nIn a place designed to strip every last vestige of humanity from its victims, to reduce men to numbers and animals, Kolbe did the unthinkable. He reflected the character of God. In that moment, he was a perfect image-bearer. He demonstrated the same sacrificial love that Christ showed on the cross, the love that says, \"Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends\" (John 15:13). He chose to enter the darkness in place of another, to become a substitute, to offer his life as a ransom.\n\nFor two weeks, Kolbe led the other nine prisoners in prayers and hymns, turning a bunker of death into a chapel of hope. He was the last to die, killed by a lethal injection of carbolic acid on August 14, 1941. He was a man made of dust, but in his final act, he was a perfect image of the divine. He proved that even in the deepest darkness, the image of God in humanity cannot be fully extinguished. It can shine forth, a beacon of love and sacrifice, a testament to the God who created us to be reflections of His glory.",
