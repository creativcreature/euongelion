      "passage": "One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer — at three in the afternoon. Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts. When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money. Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, 'Look at us!' So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.\n\nThen Peter said, 'Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.' Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong. He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God. When all the people saw him walking and praising God, they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him."

          "body": "In 1785, a 26-year-old British politician named William Wilberforce sat alone on a hilltop in the English countryside, wrestling with a conviction he could neither escape nor explain. He had recently experienced what he called 'the great change' — a sincere conversion to Christianity that reoriented his entire understanding of purpose and responsibility. But now he faced a terrifying question: Could he remain in Parliament and still follow Christ wholeheartedly?\n\nAt that time, politics was known for bribery, ego, and ruthless ambition. Many new believers abandoned public life to embrace private devotion. Wilberforce wondered if he must do the same.\n\nUnsure, he sought counsel from the aging former slave-ship captain turned Anglican minister John Newton, author of Amazing Grace. Newton told him something shocking: 'God has raised you up for this very thing. Stay in Parliament. Serve Him there.'\n\nIt was in the wake of that conversation that Wilberforce learned about the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade — the overcrowded ships, the brutal conditions, the staggering loss of life.\n\nHe had no plan, no strategy, no idea how fierce the opposition would be. What he had was conviction — a sense that God was calling him into public witness, not private retreat.\n\nAt that moment, Wilberforce felt wildly unqualified. The political system was stacked against him. The slave trade was economically entrenched. The opposition would be powerful. But what he did next mirrored the pattern we see in Acts: He gathered a small group of believers. They prayed. They sought the Spirit's guidance. They committed themselves to truth, integrity, and courage.\n\nBefore the speeches, before the campaigns, before the votes — the movement began in quiet rooms, in prayer, in the company of a handful of people who believed Jesus still acted through His followers."
