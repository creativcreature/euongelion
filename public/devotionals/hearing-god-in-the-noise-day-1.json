He speaks primarily through His Word and the Holy Spirit's gentle promptings in our hearts.\n\nIn a noisy world, many voices claim our attention - cultural messages, inner fears, even the enemy's lies. But God's voice is loving, true, and freeing, whereas the enemy's voice brings lies and condemnation. Most importantly, God's voice will never contradict Scripture.",

Another insisted, 'Think of your résumé.' Her parents had their own expectations.\n\nAva realized she'd been listening to everyone except God. In desperation, one evening she turned off her phone, opened her Bible, and prayed, 'God, speak to me.'\n\nIn the stillness that followed, a gentle thought surfaced - reminding her of Jesus' promise: 'Seek first the kingdom of God.'

The noise was deafening.\n\nBut the real challenge wasn't external - it was internal. Marcus realized he'd been listening to fear (What if I fail?), pride (I need to prove myself), and comparison (Everyone else seems to have it figured out) more than he'd been listening to God.\n\nThe breakthrough came when he started each day asking, 'God, what is Your voice saying about today?' instead of immediately checking his phone for everyone else's voices.",
      "historicalContext": "In ancient Israel, shepherds sometimes gave each sheep a name and could call them individually. The sheep would respond to their own name spoken in the familiar voice of their shepherd. Jesus likewise said, 'He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out' (John 10:3).",
