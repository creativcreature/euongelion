        "text": "Now Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, \"We have seen the Lord!\" But he said to them, \"Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.\" A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\" Thomas said to him, \"My Lord and my God!\" Then Jesus told him, \"Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\" Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name."

Lordship isn't about external compliance but about internal alignment with his will and character.\n\nJesus as God (theos) acknowledges Jesus's divine nature and his worthiness of worship, trust, and ultimate allegiance.

This means beginning each day by remembering who we are in Christ, using a decision-making filter that asks 'How does this align with Jesus's character and teaching?', and regularly affirming truths about our identity in Christ.\n\nAcknowledging Jesus as God means developing practices that recognize his divine nature: daily worship through prayer, Scripture reading, and worship; gratitude practices that recognize every good thing comes from him; and creating regular rhythms of rest that acknowledge God's sovereignty.\n\nJesus's lordship should influence how we approach every major area of life: evaluating how we spend our time in light of his priorities, viewing our resources as gifts from God to be used for his purposes, considering how our work can serve God's purposes, and investing more deeply in relationships.\n\nEven after making Thomas's confession, most believers continue to wrestle with questions and doubts.

Dr. Martinez, the researcher whose cancer treatment she had investigated, was calling to invite her to Houston for a special event. 'We're celebrating our 100th patient to achieve complete remission,' he said. 'None of this would have happened without your article. You gave us credibility when the medical establishment was dismissing our work.'\n\nSarah flew to Houston and found herself in a room filled with patients, families, doctors, and researchers. As she listened to story after story of people whose lives had been saved by the treatment she had helped bring to public attention, she realized that her decision to follow the evidence--despite the professional cost--had literally saved lives.\n\nBut the most profound moment came when Maria Santos, the mother of three Sarah had interviewed a year earlier, approached her with tears in her eyes. 'My daughter just got accepted to medical school,' Maria said. 'She wants to become an oncologist because of what happened to me. She says she wants to help other families the way Dr. Martinez helped ours.'\n\nAs Sarah drove back to the airport, she reflected on how her investigation had changed her understanding of truth, evidence, and courage. She had learned that sometimes the most rational thing you can do is believe something that seems impossible, when the evidence demands it. But more than that, she had learned that believing the truth--really believing it, to the point where it changes how you live--can have consequences far beyond what you can imagine.\n\nHer article hadn't just reported on a medical breakthrough; it had become part of the story itself. By having the courage to follow the evidence and report what she found, she had helped save lives and advance medical science. Sarah realized that this was what authentic belief looked like: not just intellectual acknowledgment, but commitment that transforms both the believer and the world around them.",
