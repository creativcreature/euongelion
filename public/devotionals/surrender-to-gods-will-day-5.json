Any external authority—be it tradition, community, or God—that seeks to constrain the self is seen as oppressive.\n\nThe gospel message is a direct assault on this idol. It says that your heart is deceitful (Jeremiah 17:9), that your old self must be crucified with Christ (Romans 6:6), and that you must deny yourself to follow Him (Luke 9:23).

Nineveh was the capital of Assyria, a brutal and pagan empire that was Israel's sworn enemy. The command was distasteful and dangerous.\n\nJonah's response was immediate and decisive: he ran. He went down to Joppa, found a ship heading for Tarshish—the opposite direction of Nineveh—and paid the fare to get as far away from God's will as possible. He was trying to save his life, his comfort, and his nationalistic prejudice.\n\nBut the cost of his non-surrender was catastrophic. A violent storm threatened to tear the ship apart. The pagan sailors, terrified for their lives, were casting lots and praying to their gods while Jonah slept in the hold. His attempt to save his own life was now endangering the lives of everyone around him. When he was finally discovered and thrown overboard, the storm ceased, but Jonah was swallowed by a great fish.\n\nIt was only in that place of utter darkness and desperation that Jonah finally surrendered, praying, 'Salvation comes from the Lord' (Jonah 2:9).",
