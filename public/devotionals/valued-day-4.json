Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 3:9: 'For we are co-workers in God's service; you are God's field, God's building.'\n\nThis verse revolutionizes how we see ourselves. We're not charity cases in God's kingdom; we're partners in His work. We're not problems to be solved; we're fields to be cultivated and buildings to be constructed. Nick's ministry didn't happen despite his condition — it happened because God was building something magnificent through it.\n\nEvery believer is entrusted with mysteries that God wants to reveal through their unique story.

      "historicalContext": "In first-century Corinth, the concept of divine purpose was typically reserved for the elite — philosophers, rulers, and priests. Paul democratizes purpose by declaring that every believer, regardless of status, is God's co-worker, field, and building — language that would have been revolutionary for slaves, women, and the poor in his audience.",
      "fascinatingFact": "The Greek word for 'co-worker' (synergos) is the root of our English word 'synergy.' Paul is saying our relationship with God is not master-slave or employer-employee — it is collaborative. God invites us into His work, and the combined result is greater than either party alone. Even our limitations contribute to the synergy.",
