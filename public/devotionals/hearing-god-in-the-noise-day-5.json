      "body": "Our emotions are a God-given part of us, but Scripture warns that the heart (our inner feelings and desires) can be 'deceitful above all things.' That doesn't mean our feelings are always wrong; it means they're not a reliable stand-alone guide.\n\nThink of Peter, who felt sure he would never abandon Jesus, but later that very night he denied Him three times. Peter's emotional confidence wasn't the same as God's reality. Or consider Saul (later Paul) - he felt he was serving God by persecuting Christians, until Jesus appeared and corrected him.\n\nSo how do we discern between God's voice and our own inner voice?\n\nFirst: God's voice aligns with Scripture's unchanging truth, whereas our feelings often fluctuate.\n\nSecond: God's voice brings a wisdom and peace that transcends momentary emotion. Colossians 3:15 says 'Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts.'\n\nThird: Seek wise counsel. Proverbs 11:14 notes that 'in an abundance of counselors there is safety.'",

His excitement soared at the idea of adventure abroad. He prayed, 'God, I feel so strongly that You want me to go!'\n\nWeeks later, however, the overseas position fell through due to unforeseen issues. Daniel was crushed. 'But God, I felt You leading me!' he lamented.\n\nIn the aftermath, a mentor gently challenged him: Had God clearly said to go, or had Daniel assumed his strong feelings were God's voice? Daniel decided to slow down and seek God afresh - spending extra time in Scripture, fasting, and asking for wise counsel.\n\nOver time, a different picture emerged: he noticed in prayer a recurring sense of peace about staying and serving in his own community first. It wasn't as glamorous as his original plan, but it aligned with a Bible principle that kept coming to mind: 'Whoever can be trusted with little can also be trusted with much' (Luke 16:10).",

      "body": "Sarah was known for her 'gut instincts' in business. She prided herself on making quick decisions based on how things 'felt.' This approach had served her well professionally, so she applied it to her spiritual life too.\n\nBut when Sarah's feelings led her to make several poor relational choices - each time convinced 'God was leading' - she began to question her discernment. A wise mentor helped her see that while emotions are important, they need to be submitted to Scripture and wise counsel.\n\nSarah learned to ask three questions before acting on strong feelings: 'Does this align with Scripture?' 'Do wise counselors agree?' and 'Does this bring lasting peace or just temporary excitement?'",
      "historicalContext": "The ancient world understood the heart's complexity. Egyptian wisdom literature warned against trusting emotions alone. Greek philosophers like Aristotle distinguished between different types of desires and the need for reason to guide emotion. The Hebrew Scriptures go deeper, recognizing that the heart's corruption affects not just emotions but thoughts and will. This is why Psalm 139:23-24 prays, 'Search me, O God, and know my heart... See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.'",
      "fascinatingFact": "Martin Luther once wrote: 'Feelings come and feelings go, And feelings are deceiving: My warrant is the Word of God, Naught else is worth believing.' It's a reminder that while emotions have their place, God's Word is the final authority over what we think we're 'hearing.'",
