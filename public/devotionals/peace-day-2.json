Planning for every disaster doesn't bring peace. Controlling your environment doesn't stop chaos.\n\nAll it does is exhaust you.\n\nJesus wasn't saying, \"Don't care about your life.\" He was saying, **\"Stop trying to secure it through control. You can't.\"**",

Are you not much more valuable than they?\"**\n\nHe wasn't saying, \"Be passive. Don't work. Don't plan.\"\n\nHe was saying: **Your value isn't dependent on your ability to control outcomes.**\n\nGod cares for you. Not because you've managed everything perfectly. But because you're His.\n\nThe anxiety of control says: If I don't hold it together, everything falls apart.\n\nThe peace of the kingdom says: God holds it together. You can let go.",
