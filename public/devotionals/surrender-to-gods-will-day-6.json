      "body": "In the second century, a plague swept through the Roman Empire, killing up to a third of the population in some areas. The pagan response was driven by fear and self-preservation. People abandoned their sick family members, leaving them to die in the streets. Doctors refused to treat the afflicted. The social fabric of the empire began to unravel.\n\nBut the Christians responded differently. In a letter, Dionysius, a bishop from that time, described how the Christians, 'heedless of danger, took charge of the sick, attending to their every need and ministering to them in Christ.' They brought food and water to those who had been abandoned. They held the dying in their arms. Many of these Christian caregivers contracted the plague themselves and died, having made the ultimate sacrifice of love.\n\nThis extraordinary, self-sacrificial love had a profound effect on the pagan world. Sociologist Rodney Stark, in his book The Rise of Christianity, argues that the Christian response to this and other plagues was one of the primary drivers of the church's explosive growth. The pagans saw a community that cared for the weak, that did not fear death, and that loved one another with a supernatural love.",
