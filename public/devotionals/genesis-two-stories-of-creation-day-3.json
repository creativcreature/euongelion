      "body": "In 2010, Kate Ogg gave birth to twins, Emily and Jamie, at only 27 weeks. Emily was born healthy, but Jamie was delivered limp and silent. For twenty minutes, doctors worked to revive him, but he showed no signs of life. They pronounced him dead and handed his small, lifeless body to his mother so she could say goodbye. Kate took her son and laid him on her bare chest, a practice known as \"kangaroo care.\" She and her husband, David, spoke to him, told him his name, and poured out their love for the son they had just lost.\n\nFor two hours, Kate held her son, skin-to-skin, her warmth enveloping his cold body. She held him not to revive him, but simply to be with him, to love him in his final moments. But then, something miraculous happened. The baby began to gasp. The doctor dismissed it as a reflex, but Kate felt the life in him. She held him closer, and he began to breathe. Slowly, miraculously, Jamie came back to life, his breath returning, his color changing from gray to pink. The doctors were stunned. The baby they had declared dead was now alive and well, resting in the warmth of his mother's embrace.\n\nThis is a modern-day picture of Genesis 2:7. We are born spiritually lifeless, separated from God. But He does not abandon us. He draws near, holds us close, and breathes His own life into us. The story of Jamie Ogg is a testament to the power of presence, of warmth, of a love that refuses to let go. It is a beautiful illustration of the God who kneels in the dust, holds us in His arms, and breathes His own Spirit into our lungs, turning what was lifeless into a living soul.",
