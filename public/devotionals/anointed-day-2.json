Wait for power.\n\nThis tells us something crucial about the anointing: knowledge isn't enough. Good intentions aren't enough. Even passion for God isn't enough. You need the dynamis — the explosive, life-altering power of the Holy Spirit — to accomplish what God has called you to.\n\nNotice what the power is for: witnessing. Not performing. Not impressing. Not building a platform. The anointing of the Spirit makes you a witness — someone whose very presence testifies to the reality of God.\n\nLuke 4:18 records Jesus reading from Isaiah in the Nazareth synagogue: 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor... to set at liberty those who are oppressed.'
