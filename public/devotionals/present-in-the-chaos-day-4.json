      "body": "Micah 6:8 is often quoted as a summary of what God requires. But the context matters. God is bringing a covenant lawsuit against Israel. Through Micah, He asks: What have I done to burden you? I brought you out of Egypt, gave you leaders, protected you from enemies. And how do you respond? With empty rituals, burnt offerings, rivers of oil.\n\nThen comes the pivot: 'He has told you, O man, what is good.' Not more sacrifices. Not grander gestures. Three things: justice, mercy, humble walking. The Hebrew chesed, translated 'kindness' or 'mercy,' means loyal, covenantal love. God is not asking for occasional niceness. He is asking for the kind of steadfast love that remains when it is not reciprocated.\n\nThis is the foundation for responding to accusation and suspicion. When people question your motives, the temptation is to justify yourself. Micah's prescription is different: do the right thing, love mercy even toward your accusers, and walk quietly with God. Let your integrity speak. Let your humility defend you.",

Paul later quoted this passage in Romans 12:20, embedding it in the broader command to overcome evil with good.\n\nThe 'burning coals' image has generated centuries of debate.

      "historicalContext": "Micah prophesied during the 8th century BC, a period of prosperity and corruption in both Israel and Judah. The wealthy exploited the poor, religious leaders performed elaborate rituals while ignoring injustice, and prophets like Micah, Amos, and Isaiah called the people back to covenantal faithfulness. Micah 6:8 is the climax of that prophetic indictment.",
      "fascinatingFact": "The Hebrew word hatznea (walk humbly) appears only once in the entire Hebrew Bible, here in Micah 6:8. Scholars call this a hapax legomenon, a word used only once. Its rarity suggests Micah was reaching for something precise that no existing word could capture: a quiet, careful, attentive posture of walking with God that resists both self-promotion and self-pity.",
