        "text": "Now Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, \"We have seen the Lord!\" But he said to them, \"Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.\" A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\" Thomas said to him, \"My Lord and my God!\" Then Jesus told him, \"Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\" Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name."

He was essentially asking for scientific evidence--physical, tangible, reproducible proof that Jesus had risen from the dead. Jesus provided that evidence, but he also pointed beyond it to a different kind of knowing that would be necessary for future believers.\n\nWhile empirical evidence is crucial for understanding the physical world, it has limitations when it comes to questions of meaning, purpose, relationship, and transcendence. Some of the most important realities in human experience--love, beauty, justice, consciousness itself--cannot be fully captured by scientific measurement alone.\n\nThomas's approach provides a model for how we might evaluate spiritual claims today. It involves honest skepticism that doesn't dismiss claims out of hand but also doesn't accept them uncritically. It involves openness to evidence--when Jesus provided the requested proof, Thomas didn't move the goalposts. It involves appropriate response--extraordinary evidence led to extraordinary commitment. And it involves personal investigation--Thomas insisted on his own encounter with the evidence.\n\nMost of what we believe about the world comes not from direct experience but from testimony--the reports of others whom we trust. Jesus's blessing on those who 'have not seen and yet have believed' acknowledges that most people throughout history would need to make their decision about him based on testimony rather than direct physical evidence.\n\nFor modern readers, we have access to historical evidence, textual evidence from the New Testament documents, experiential evidence from transformed lives, moral evidence from Jesus's ethical teaching, and philosophical evidence from how Christian faith addresses fundamental human questions.

The question now was whether she had the courage to follow that evidence wherever it led, even if it meant challenging her own assumptions and risking her reputation.\n\nSarah took a deep breath and clicked 'Send' on the third version.
