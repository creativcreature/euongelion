The climate crisis is still accelerating. Democracy is still fracturing. Your anxiety is still real.\n\nAnd when you can't see the outcome, paralysis sets in.\n\nWhy act if it won't change anything? Why hope if things might not get better? Why be faithful if you can't see the point?\n\nThe uncertainty becomes an excuse for inaction.\n\nBut here's the truth: **Faithfulness isn't waiting until you can see the outcome. It's acting even when you can't.**\n\nThe question isn't \"Will it work?\" The question is \"What does faithfulness look like right now?\"",

They're ordinary.\n\nBut in the darkness, **ordinary faithfulness becomes radical hope.**\n\nBecause you're not acting based on outcomes.

Just **being present.**\n\nPresent to God in prayer, even when it feels like shouting into the void.\nPresent to others in community, even when you're struggling yourself.\nPresent to your own grief, instead of numbing it.\nPresent to the moment, instead of catastrophizing the future.\n\n**Presence is resistance.**\n\nIn a world that demands productivity, performance, and outcomes, simply being present—to God, to others, to yourself—is an act of defiance.\n\nIt says: **\"I'm here. I'm not running. I'm trusting that presence matters even when I can't see results.\"**\n\nThat's faithfulness in the dark.",
