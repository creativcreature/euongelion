This isn't about occasional connection but permanent attachment. A branch doesn't visit the vine; it lives in the vine, drawing constant life and nourishment.\n\nJesus repeats this word eleven times in John 15:1-11, emphasizing that fruitful Christian life isn't about periodic spiritual experiences but continuous spiritual residence. The branch that tries to bear fruit while disconnected from the vine will wither and die.\n\nMost of us have been taught to 'spend time with God' - which implies that the rest of our time is spent without Him. But Jesus calls us to something deeper: to live our entire lives connected to Him, drawing strength and direction from His presence moment by moment.",

She'd drive to church on Sundays, visit God during her morning devotions, and check in with Him during crisis moments.

God didn't just visit Israel occasionally - He pitched His tent (tabernacle) in their midst and traveled with them.\n\nWhen Jesus said 'the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us' (John 1:14), the Greek word for 'dwelling' is related to the Hebrew shakan. Jesus literally 'tabernacled' with humanity, showing us that God's desire is not occasional visits but permanent presence.\n\nThe progression is clear:\n- Old Testament: God dwells among His people (externally)\n- Gospels: God dwells with His people (incarnationally)\n- New Testament: God dwells in His people (internally through the Spirit)",
