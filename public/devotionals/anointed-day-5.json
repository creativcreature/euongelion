It was always meant to flow through you.\n\nJesus' final words to His disciples are not a suggestion — they're a commission. Go. Make disciples. Baptize. Teach. And the promise that makes it all possible: 'I am with you always, to the end of the age.'\n\nThe anointing you've received this week is not a private possession. It's a public assignment. Paul put it bluntly in Romans 10: 'How are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!'\n\nYour anointed feet are beautiful because they carry the gospel to people who need it.\n\nJohn 20 captures the most intimate commissioning in all of Scripture. The risen Jesus appears to His frightened disciples, breathes on them, and says: 'Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you.' The breath of Christ — the same breath that spoke creation into existence — is the breath that sends you into the world.\n\nYou're not going alone. You're going as one who has been chosen, empowered, trained, and healed. Now go.",
