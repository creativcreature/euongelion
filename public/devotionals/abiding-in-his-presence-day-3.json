The Greek word for 'dwelling' (skenoo) is directly related to the Hebrew shakan - the same word used to describe God's presence in the tabernacle.\n\nBut here's what's revolutionary: God didn't just visit humanity temporarily like He did in the Old Testament. Through Jesus, God made a permanent relocation. He didn't come as a tourist or even as a long-term guest - He came to stay.\n\nThis changes everything about how we understand God's presence in our lives. We're not trying to visit God in some distant heaven - He has moved into our neighborhood, our circumstances, our ordinary Tuesday afternoons. The question isn't 'How do I get to God?' but 'How do I recognize that God has already moved in with me?'",

The temple represented God's commitment to dwell permanently with His people in a specific place.\n\nNew Testament Era: Through Jesus and the Holy Spirit, God's presence becomes personal and portable again - but this time, permanently resident within believers themselves.\n\nWe are now God's temple (1 Corinthians 6:19), which means His presence isn't just with us - it's in us, permanently.",
