These practices help us maintain focus on kingdom values even when cultural pressures pull us toward self-centered living.\n\nMorning Practices: Begin each day by remembering your identity as a follower of Jesus and asking how you can serve his kingdom that day. Read Scripture with the specific question: 'How is Jesus calling me to deny myself today?' Pray for opportunities to serve others and for wisdom to recognize those opportunities when they arise.\n\nEvening Practices: Reflect on the day's choices - where did you choose service over self-interest? Where did you fall short? Confess failures and accept God's forgiveness, while also learning from mistakes. Plan specific ways to live more faithfully tomorrow based on today's experiences.\n\nThis involves regular self-examination, confession when we fall short, and recommitment to following Jesus more faithfully. It also involves accepting God's grace and forgiveness when we fail, and allowing that grace to motivate continued growth rather than complacency.",

Michael had performed surgeries in conditions that would have been unthinkable in his previous practice, had watched patients die from conditions that would have been easily treatable with better resources, and had lived more simply than he ever had before.\n\nBut he had also experienced transformation he couldn't have imagined. He had trained twelve local doctors who were now providing cardiac care throughout the region. He had helped establish three satellite clinics that were serving remote communities. He had developed new surgical techniques adapted for resource-limited settings that were now being used in similar programs around the world.\n\nAfter his presentation, several doctors approached Michael to ask about opportunities for similar service. Dr. Chen, who had taken the Johns Hopkins position Michael had declined, pulled him aside. 'I've achieved everything I thought I wanted,' he said quietly. 'But listening to you today, I realize I may have gained the world but lost something essential about why I became a doctor in the first place.'",
