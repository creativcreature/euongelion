The busier she became, the more she forgot what really mattered.\n\nShe forgot to call her parents. Forgot to nurture friendships. Forgot to enjoy simple pleasures. And most dangerously, she forgot God - not intellectually, but practically. Her schedule had no room for the One who gave her life.\n\nThe wake-up call came when she realized: I've become so busy managing my life that I've forgotten who my life belongs to.",

But this external memory made his internal memory lazy. He could recall data instantly but struggled to remember what mattered most.\n\nThe irony was stark: I have access to all knowledge but am forgetting the most important knowledge - who God is and who I am to Him.",

This makes us vulnerable to practical atheism - living as if God doesn't exist, even when we intellectually believe He does."
