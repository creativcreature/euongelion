This is God revealing His first choice. The world builds kingdoms on strength, talent, and prestige. God builds His kingdom on surrendered weakness — because weakness is the only material through which His power can shine without competition.\n\nNick Vujicic's lack of limbs wasn't a mistake in God's design; it was a deliberate choice to showcase divine power through human weakness.
