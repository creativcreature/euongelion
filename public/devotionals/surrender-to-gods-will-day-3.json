But both ancient philosophy and modern psychology reveal the flaws in this understanding.\n\nPhilosopher Isaiah Berlin distinguished between two types of liberty: 'negative liberty' (freedom from interference) and 'positive liberty' (freedom for self-mastery and purpose). The world clamors for 'freedom from' rules and authority. But this often leads to what psychologists call 'the paradox of choice'—anxiety and paralysis in the face of too many options. Christianity offers 'freedom for'—the power to become the person you were created to be.\n\nThe Bible's diagnosis of the human condition is that we are slaves to sin (John 8:34).

      "body": "Augustine of Hippo, one of the most influential theologians in history, spent his youth and early adulthood as a slave to his own passions. He was brilliant, ambitious, and driven by a desire for worldly success and sensual pleasure. In his famous autobiography, Confessions, he describes his inner turmoil: 'I was in bondage to a chain of my own making.' He knew the truth and was drawn to it, but he felt powerless to change. His famous prayer from this time was, 'Lord, grant me chastity and continence, but not yet.'\n\nHe was trapped. The more he tried to free himself through his own willpower, the more entangled he became. He was a slave to his own 'freedom'—the freedom to do whatever he wanted, which had led him into a prison of addiction and despair.\n\nThe breakthrough came when he finally surrendered. Sitting in a garden in Milan, weeping over his spiritual impotence, he heard a child's voice chanting, 'Tolle, lege; tolle, lege' ('Take up and read'). He picked up a scroll of the apostle Paul's letters and his eyes fell on Romans 13:13-14. In that moment, Augustine stopped fighting and surrendered his will to Christ. He realized that true freedom wasn't the power to do anything he wanted, but the power to do what is right.",
