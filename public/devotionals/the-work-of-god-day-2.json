Jesus answered, 'Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.' Then they asked him, 'What must we do to do the works God requires?' Jesus answered, 'The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.' So they asked him, 'What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: He gave them bread from heaven to eat.' Jesus said to them, 'Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.' 'Sir,' they said, 'always give us this bread.' Then Jesus declared, 'I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.'"

First, the source was not Moses, but the Father: 'It is not Moses who has given you the bread... but it is my Father who gives you the true bread.' Jesus shifts their focus from the human agent (Moses) to the divine source (the Father). The manna was a gift from God, not a feat of Moses. Second, the manna was a shadow, not the reality: Jesus introduces the concept of the 'true bread.' The word alethinos means 'genuine' or 'real.' It implies that the manna, as miraculous as it was, was only a temporary, physical foreshadowing of a greater, spiritual reality.\n\nJesus then describes the characteristics of this 'true bread': it comes from heaven (it is of divine origin, not earthly), and it gives life to the world (its scope is universal, not limited to the nation of Israel). The manna sustained the life of one nation in the wilderness; the true bread gives eternal life to the entire world. This is a radical expansion of the crowd's vision.

His brother was recounting a recent trip to Europe, describing the fine meals and luxurious hotels. His cousin was talking about her son's acceptance into a prestigious university. It was the same as every year — a parade of achievements, a feast of accomplishments.\n\nIn the past, this would have filled Liam with a mixture of envy and inadequacy. He would have been mentally preparing his own meager offering to this potluck of success. But today, something was different. After his moment of clarity in the study the day before, he was hearing the conversation with new ears.\n\nHe realized that all these stories, as impressive as they were, were stories about 'manna.' They were about temporary provision, fleeting successes, food that spoils. The European vacation was over. The university acceptance was a great achievement, but it was not a guarantee of a happy or meaningful life. It was all bread for a day.\n\nHe looked across the table at his father, a man who had built a successful business from nothing. For his entire life, his father had been a provider of manna — for his family, for his employees, for his community. Liam had always seen this as the ultimate success. But now, he saw the toll it had taken. His father looked tired, burdened by the constant pressure to keep the manna coming.\n\nLater, as Liam was helping his mother clear the table, she spoke quietly to him. 'Your father is proud of you, you know.'\n\n'He has a funny way of showing it,' Liam replied, stacking the plates.\n\n'He doesn't know how to show it,' she corrected gently. 'All he knows is how to provide. He thinks that's what love is. He gave you and your brother everything he never had. But I think he's starting to realize it wasn't enough.'\n\nThat evening, Liam found his father sitting alone on the porch, staring out at the darkening sky. Liam sat down next to him, and for a long time, they just sat in silence.\n\nFinally, Liam spoke. 'Dad, I've been thinking about the story of the manna in the wilderness. It was a miracle, a gift from God to keep the people alive. But it was never meant to be the final destination. It was just provision for the journey.'\n\nHis father looked at him, a flicker of interest in his tired eyes.\n\n'I feel like we spend our whole lives chasing after manna,' Liam continued, his voice quiet but sure. 'The next promotion, the next success, the next achievement. We think that's the bread that will satisfy us. But it always runs out. Jesus said that the true bread, the bread that gives real life, is a gift from the Father. It's not something we can earn or achieve.'\n\nHis father didn't respond, but he didn't look away. He just kept looking at his son, as if seeing him for the first time.\n\nLiam wasn't trying to preach. He was simply sharing the truth that was beginning to transform his own heart. He was realizing that the hunger he felt, the hunger they all felt, was not for more manna. It was for the true bread from heaven. And for the first time, he felt a deep, genuine gratitude, not for what he had achieved, but for the gift he was beginning to receive.",

It was a daily reminder of God's miraculous provision and their complete dependence on him. However, the Old Testament itself hints that there is a deeper hunger that physical bread cannot satisfy. Deuteronomy 8:3 says, 'He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.'
