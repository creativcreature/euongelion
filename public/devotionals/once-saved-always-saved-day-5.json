      "passage": "Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed - not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence - continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose. Do everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, 'children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.' In them you shine like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain. But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you. So you too should be glad and rejoice with me."

She had been offered a position as chief of pediatric oncology at a prestigious research hospital. Instead, she turned it down to accept a position at a smaller hospital serving primarily low-income families.\n\n'David, I need to tell you something,' Sarah said. 'Watching you and Emma this past year has changed how I think about faith. I've been a Christian for years, but I think I've been living like my relationship with God depends on my ability to be good enough, smart enough, and successful enough.'\n\nShe continued: 'I've been trying to earn God's approval through my achievements rather than trusting that he already loves me and has a purpose for my life. I took this job because I thought it would make me worthy of his blessing. But maybe the question isn't \"What do I need to do to earn God's favor?\" but \"How do I respond to the favor he's already shown me?\"'\n\n'So you're saying that working out your salvation isn't about trying to prove you're saved but about living like someone who is already saved?'
