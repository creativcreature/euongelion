The Hebrew contrasts nachat (rest, quietness, contentment) with amal (toil, labor, trouble) and re'ut ruach (chasing after wind).\n\nSolomon observed that the pursuit of more often costs us the ability to enjoy what we have. The person with full hands but no rest is poorer than the person with less but peace.",

Every opportunity felt urgent, every invitation felt mandatory, every project felt essential.\n\nHis grandfather, a farmer, watched Kevin's frantic activity: 'Son, you're working so hard to get more that you're missing what you already have.'\n\nThe wisdom hit like lightning: What if I'm so busy filling my hands that I can't receive what God wants to give me?",

But the more she gained, the more anxious she became.\n\nThe breakthrough came during a power outage that forced her to sit in silence for three hours. In that stillness, she realized: I have everything I thought I wanted and nothing I actually need.",

The result is exactly what Ecclesiastes predicted - both hands full of toil and chasing after wind."
