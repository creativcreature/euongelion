And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man."

Kenegdo means \"opposite him\" or \"corresponding to him.\" It suggests a relationship of mutuality, of face-to-face partnership.",

They were both professors, both veterans of the Great War, and both lovers of myth and language. They formed a small, informal group of like-minded friends called \"The Inklings.\" They would meet on Thursday nights in Lewis's rooms at Magdalen College, sharing drinks, conversation, and, most importantly, their own creative work.\n\nIt was in this circle of trust and honest feedback that two of the greatest fantasy worlds of all time were born. Tolkien would read aloud from his sprawling, epic manuscript, a story of hobbits and elves and a dark lord in the land of Mordor. Lewis would share chapters from his own imaginative tales, stories of talking animals and a magical land called Narnia. The other members of the group would listen, critique, and encourage. They were \"helpers,\" partners in the creative process, sharpening each other's ideas and pushing each other toward excellence.\n\nLewis and Tolkien were profoundly different in their personalities and their faith, but they were united by a shared love of story and a deep respect for each other's gifts. Tolkien's Catholic faith was instrumental in Lewis's conversion from atheism to Christianity. Lewis's encouragement was a key factor in Tolkien's decision to persevere with his massive, unconventional novel, \"The Lord of the Rings.\" They were an ezer kenegdo for each other, a helper and a partner who, together, created something that neither could have created alone. Their friendship is a powerful testament to the truth that we are made for community, that our greatest works are often born out of the soil of deep, committed relationships.",
