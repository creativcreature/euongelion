And the God who starts things finishes them. Your current struggle isn't evidence that God has given up on you. It's proof He's still at work.\n\nThis is the foundation of confident faith: it doesn't rest on our ability to hold onto God but on God's commitment to hold onto us.

The former Olympic gymnast whispered through tears, 'God, I trusted You. I prayed before every routine, thanked You for every medal. Where were You when I fell?'\n\nThe silence felt deafening. Twenty years of discipline, sacrifice, and faith, and this was how the story ended? A shattered knee and an empty gym.\n\nBut in that moment of raw honesty, something unexpected happened. Her doubt wasn't destroying her faith. It was stripping away the shallow version she'd built around achievement and replacing it with something she didn't yet have words for. Her angry prayer was the most honest conversation she'd had with God in years.",

It's recognition of God's presence in pain. When unbelief whispers that God has abandoned us, gratitude shouts back with evidence of His faithfulness. Every breath, every sunrise, every person who still shows up for us becomes proof that God hasn't forgotten us.\n\nFaith isn't a solo journey either.
