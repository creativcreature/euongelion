        "text": "Now Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, \"We have seen the Lord!\" But he said to them, \"Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.\" A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\" Thomas said to him, \"My Lord and my God!\" Then Jesus told him, \"Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\" Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name."

It implied that ultimate authority belonged not to Caesar but to Jesus, and that true divinity resided not in the emperor but in the risen Christ.\n\nFrom a Jewish perspective, Thomas's declaration was equally shocking. The Shema, the central confession of Jewish faith, declares: 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one' (Deuteronomy 6:4). For a devout Jew to call another human being 'God' would normally be considered blasphemy. Yet Thomas, who had been with Jesus for three years, somehow understood that calling Jesus 'God' didn't contradict Jewish monotheism but fulfilled it.\n\nJohn's Gospel was likely written to a community that was facing persecution for their beliefs about Jesus. Many of the original readers would have been wrestling with the same question Thomas faced: Is Jesus really worth the cost of believing in him? Thomas's story would have been deeply encouraging--here was someone who had demanded the highest level of proof, received it, and then made the ultimate confession of faith despite the personal and social costs.\n\nJohn explicitly states his purpose in writing: 'These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name' (20:31).
