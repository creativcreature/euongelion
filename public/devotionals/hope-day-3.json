It walks through it.",

He wasn't confident. He was terrified.\n\nSo terrified that Luke says **he sweat drops of blood**—a rare medical condition caused by extreme anguish.\n\nThis is Jesus. Fully God. Fully human. And fully afraid.\n\nHe didn't skip the terror. He didn't spiritualize it away. He brought it to God and said, **\"I don't want to do this.\"**\n\nThat's not weak faith. That's honest faith.",

I don't want this.\"**\n\nFollowed by radical trust: **\"But I trust You anyway.\"**\n\nThis is the pattern of kingdom hope: **Acknowledge the darkness. Trust God in it.**\n\nJesus didn't pretend the crucifixion wasn't horrifying. He named it. He grieved it. He asked God to change it.\n\nBut when God didn't, he walked into it anyway.\n\nNot because he could see the resurrection. But because he trusted the Father even in the dark.\n\nThat's faithfulness in the dark. That's the hope we're invited into.",
