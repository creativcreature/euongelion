King Solomon, with unlimited resources and endless opportunities, looked at his packed schedule and declared: 'Hevel! Meaningless! All is meaningless!'\n\nSolomon wasn't being pessimistic; he was being honest about the nature of human activity apart from God. He conducted the ultimate productivity experiment - trying achievement, pleasure, wisdom, work, and wealth. His conclusion? Without God at the center, it's all hevel - vapor that appears substantial but vanishes when examined closely.\n\nThis isn't a condemnation of work or achievement. It's an exposure of the futility of activity that lacks eternal purpose and divine connection.",

Her calendar looked like a game of Tetris played by someone having an anxiety attack.\n\nShe paused at her desk, staring at the motivational poster: 'Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out.' But what if those efforts were leading nowhere?\n\nThe question hit her like cold water: What if I'm incredibly busy doing incredibly meaningless things?",

How could that be hevel?\n\nBut late at night, when the emails finally stopped, Marcus felt the hollow ache Solomon described. He was successful, important, needed - and completely empty. He had become so busy serving God that he had forgotten how to be with God.\n\nThe revelation came during a 14-hour flight with no wifi: What if the most productive thing I could do today is nothing?",
