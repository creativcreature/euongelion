      "passage": "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all - how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died - more than that, who was raised to life - is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

Emma had responded well to treatment and was in remission.\n\n'Sarah, I need to tell you something that might sound strange coming from a pastor,' David said. 'This whole experience has convinced me that I understand much less about God than I thought I did, and somehow that's made my faith stronger, not weaker.'\n\n'For twenty years, I preached a version of Christianity that was essentially a spiritual insurance policy. If you believe the right things and live the right way, God will protect you from suffering. But that's not faith - that's a transaction. I was trying to control God rather than trust him.'\n\nDavid continued: 'Watching Emma fight for her life taught me that God's love isn't about protecting us from suffering - it's about being with us in suffering and working through it to accomplish purposes we can't see. Romans 8 has become my anchor - nothing can separate us from God's love, not because God prevents suffering, but because he works through it.'",
