When Jesus cited it as the greatest commandment, He was affirming the foundational truth that love for God should be the organizing principle of all human existence.\n\nThe fourfold structure Jesus presents is not accidental. It covers every dimension of the human person:\n\nHeart (kardia): Our emotional and volitional center, where we feel and choose.\nSoul (psyche): Our life essence, the animating force that makes us who we are.\nMind (dianoia): Our intellectual faculties, where we think, reason, and understand.\nStrength (ischys): Our physical and practical capabilities, how we act in the world.\n\nThe theological implications are demanding. This kind of love is comprehensive, leaving no compartment of life untouched. It is transformative, reordering all other relationships and priorities. And it is, frankly, impossible by human effort alone. This standard reveals our need for God's grace, as no human loves God perfectly. But it also reveals a stunning truth: God accepts our imperfect, limited, broken offering of love when it is given wholeheartedly.",
