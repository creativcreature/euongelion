The Greek word adialeiptōs means 'without intermission' or 'without gaps' - like a continuous thread woven through the fabric of daily life.\n\nThis kind of prayer isn't about adding more spiritual activities to an already busy schedule. It's about recognizing that every moment offers an opportunity for communion with God. Washing dishes becomes a time of gratitude. Commuting becomes a time of intercession. Work challenges become opportunities to seek wisdom. Relationships become contexts for experiencing and expressing God's love.\n\nThe abiding life isn't about perfect spiritual performance but about persistent spiritual awareness - maintaining the recognition that we are always connected to Jesus, always in His presence, always able to draw from His life and love.",

      "body": "Robert was a successful architect who had mastered the art of compartmentalization. He had his work life, family life, social life, and spiritual life - each with its own time, place, and expectations. His relationship with God was scheduled for Sunday mornings and Wednesday evening Bible study, with brief appearances during daily devotions.\n\nBut as Robert's career advanced and his responsibilities multiplied, those compartments began to feel increasingly artificial. He found himself facing ethical dilemmas at work, relationship challenges at home, and social pressures that his scheduled 'God time' couldn't adequately address.\n\nThe transformation began when Robert started treating his relationship with God less like an appointment and more like a marriage. Just as he didn't compartmentalize his relationship with his wife into scheduled 'spouse time,' he began to understand that abiding with Jesus meant integrating His presence into every aspect of life.\n\n'I realized that abiding isn't something I do,' Robert reflected. 'It's something I am - a person who lives in continuous communion with Jesus, whether I'm designing buildings, coaching my son's soccer team, or sleeping.'",

He wrote: 'The time of business does not with me differ from the time of prayer; and in the noise and clatter of my kitchen, while several persons are at the same time calling for different things, I possess God in as great tranquility as if I were upon my knees at the blessed sacrament.'\n\nBrother Lawrence discovered what he called 'practicing the presence of God' - a way of living that recognized every moment as an opportunity for communion with God. He didn't separate sacred and secular activities but found the sacred within the secular.\n\nThis practice aligns perfectly with Paul's instruction to 'pray continually' - not as an additional burden but as a way of recognizing the spiritual reality that already exists in every moment.",
