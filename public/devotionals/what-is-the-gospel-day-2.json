Isaiah was promising that God would make a way for the exiles to return home—literally, a highway through the wilderness between Babylon and Jerusalem. The imagery is powerful: valleys filled in, mountains leveled, rough places made smooth. This was the language of ancient road construction, preparing the way for a king's procession.\n\nMark also quotes from Malachi 3:1: 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.' Malachi, writing around 450 BC, was the last of the Old Testament prophets. He promised that God would send a messenger to prepare the way before 'the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple.' By combining Isaiah and Malachi, Mark is suggesting that John the Baptist fulfills both prophecies.",
