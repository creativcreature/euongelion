Paul uses it to describe the ultimate victory announcement: death is defeated, and you are valued beyond measure.",

The gospel isn't a set of theological facts to memorize — it's the ground we stand on when everything else shifts beneath us.\n\nWhen Nick Vujicic questioned his value as a child born without arms or legs, he was doing what every human does in seasons of pain: testing whether the gospel can hold the weight of real suffering. Paul's answer is unequivocal — hold firmly. Not because the gospel is fragile, but because our grip loosens when doubt presses in.\n\nOur value doesn't come from what we can do with our hands or feet. It comes from what Christ has done with His. When doubt whispers that we're worthless, the gospel shouts that we're priceless.",

The question haunted him through sleepless nights and tear-filled days. At age eight, he began contemplating suicide, convinced that his life had no purpose or worth.\n\nYet in those darkest moments, God was already preparing to reveal a value that transcended every human measurement.

God grows us into His purposes. Our value isn't in our ability to produce growth, but in being the soil where God chooses to work.",

      "fascinatingFact": "The word Paul uses for 'stand' (histemi) in verse 2 is the same word used for a soldier standing at his post. Our position in the gospel isn't passive — it's an active stance of trust, holding our ground when everything around us says to retreat.",
