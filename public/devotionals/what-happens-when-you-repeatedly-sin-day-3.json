Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin— because anyone who has died has been freed from sin's mastery. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness. For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under the law but under grace."

      "body": "Paul's emphatic rejection of the idea that grace encourages sin addresses a theological error that has appeared throughout church history, known as antinomianism (literally 'against law'). Some in the Roman church were apparently arguing that since grace increases where sin abounds, believers should sin more to give God more opportunities to show his grace.\n\nThe objection follows a certain logic: God's grace is magnified when it covers great sin (Romans 5:20), more sin would result in more grace and greater glory to God, therefore Christians should sin more. This logic appears sound on the surface but reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what grace actually does in the believer's life.\n\nPaul's response—μή γένοιτο (me genoito)—is his strongest possible rejection. The strength of his rejection indicates that he considers this misunderstanding of grace to be not just wrong but dangerous and offensive.\n\nPaul's argument against antinomianism is based on the reality of what happens to believers in conversion. He argues that believers have 'died to sin' (v. 2), which makes continued living in sin both illogical and impossible for those who truly understand their new identity. This 'death to sin' is not a gradual process but a definitive event that occurred at conversion.\n\nPaul uses baptism as an illustration of the believer's union with Christ in his death and resurrection (vv. 3-4). Going under the water symbolizes death and burial with Christ, representing the end of the old life dominated by sin. Coming up from the water symbolizes resurrection with Christ, representing the beginning of new life characterized by righteousness.\n\nPaul's concept of dying to an old way of life echoes the Exodus narrative. Just as Israel 'died' to their old life of slavery in Egypt and was 'raised' to new life as God's free people, believers die to slavery to sin and are raised to freedom in Christ. The concept also appears in Ezekiel's vision of the valley of dry bones (Ezekiel 37), where God promises to bring his people from death to life.\n\nCentral to Paul's argument is union with Christ—believers are so closely identified with Jesus that his death and resurrection become theirs. Christ's death to sin becomes the believer's death to sin, Christ's resurrection to new life becomes the believer's resurrection to new life, and Christ's victory over sin and death becomes the believer's victory.\n\nPaul describes the believer's former identity as having been 'crucified with him' (v. 6). The 'old self' refers to the person we were before conversion. This crucifixion is described as a completed event, not an ongoing process.\n\nBased on the reality of what God has done, Paul issues commands: 'Count yourselves dead to sin' (v. 11), 'Don't let sin reign' (v. 12), and 'Offer yourselves to God as instruments of righteousness' (v. 13).\n\nPaul concludes by explaining that believers are 'not under law but under grace' (v. 14). Grace doesn't eliminate moral standards but provides both the motivation and the power to meet them. This teaching helps distinguish between legitimate struggle (believers who hate their sin, confess it, and genuinely desire to change) and illegitimate license (using grace as an excuse to continue in sin without genuine repentance).",

His gambling addiction support group had asked him to share his story with a new member—a young man named Jake who was struggling with the same issues Marcus had faced.\n\n'The thing is,' Jake said after Marcus had shared about his repeated failures and God's ongoing forgiveness, 'it sounds like you're saying God will just keep forgiving me no matter how many times I mess up. So why should I even try to stop? If his grace covers everything, maybe I should just accept that I'm going to be a gambling addict and trust that God will forgive me each time.'\n\nMarcus felt a chill as he recognized his own thinking from just a few months earlier. He had used God's promise of forgiveness as a kind of insurance policy—a safety net that allowed him to continue in destructive behavior without fully confronting the need for change.\n\n'Jake, I understand why you'd think that way because I thought the same thing,' Marcus replied. 'But I've learned there's a huge difference between struggling with sin and using grace as an excuse to keep sinning. When I was using God's forgiveness as a license to gamble, I wasn't really repenting—I was just managing my guilt.'\n\nMarcus paused, remembering his own journey. 'Real repentance isn't just feeling sorry about the consequences of sin. It's recognizing that the sin itself is incompatible with who I am in Christ. When I gamble, I'm not just making a poor choice—I'm acting like someone who doesn't trust God to provide for my needs, someone who thinks I can find satisfaction in something other than him.'\n\nJake looked skeptical. 'But you said you've failed repeatedly. How is that different from what I'm talking about?'\n\n'The difference is direction and desire,' Marcus explained. 'When I fail now, it grieves me because it contradicts who I know I am in Christ. I don't want to gamble—it feels foreign to my new nature. Before, when I was using grace as a license, I wanted to gamble and was just looking for a way to manage the guilt. The struggle itself is evidence that God is changing me, even when I don't see perfect victory.'\n\nMarcus opened his Bible to Romans 6. 'Paul addresses this exact question. Some people in the early church were apparently saying, \"If grace increases where sin abounds, let's sin more so grace can abound even more.\" Paul's response is basically, \"Are you crazy? That completely misunderstands what grace does to us.\"'\n\nAs their conversation continued, Marcus realized that his own understanding of grace had been transformed through his struggle. He had moved from seeing grace as permission to sin to seeing it as power to change. The same forgiveness that covered his failures also provided the motivation and strength to pursue transformation.",
