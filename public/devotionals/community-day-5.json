Loneliness is still epidemic.\n\nThe ground is still shaking.\n\nBut something has changed: **You know who stays.**\n\nNot your network. Not your contacts. Not the people who valued you for what you could offer.\n\nYour covenant people. The ones who show up at 2 a.m. The ones who pool resources when you're broke. The ones who sit with you when you're falling apart.\n\nWhen everything collapses, **they remain.**",

The people who stay when it costs them something.**\n\nNot because you're useful. Not because you're winning. Because you're **theirs** and they're **yours.**\n\nThat's what survives the shaking. That's what's real.\n\nCovenant people. Bound by something stronger than transaction.",

Loneliness will still be epidemic.\n\nBut you'll carry something different: **a community that doesn't scatter.**\n\nWhen the economy crashes, your people will pool rent. When institutions fail, your people will create mutual aid. When isolation crushes others, your people will gather around the table.\n\nBecause you're not in a network anymore. You're in a covenant.\n\nAnd covenant doesn't depend on systems being stable. It depends on people staying faithful.\n\nThat's the kingdom community. It survives collapse.\n\nBecause it's built on something unshakeable: **mutual, self-giving love.**",
