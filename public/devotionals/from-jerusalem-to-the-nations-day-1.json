      "passage": "When the members of the Sanhedrin heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him. But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. \"Look,\" he said, \"I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.\" At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him, dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul. While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, \"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.\" Then he fell on his knees and cried out, \"Lord, do not hold this sin against them.\" When he had said this, he fell asleep.",

      "content": "Week 3 is the turning point of the entire book of Acts. Week 1 showed us the foundation of the early church. Week 2 showed us what happens when the Spirit-filled church steps into public life. Now Week 3 shows us how God grows His church through service, suffering, and surprise.\n\nActs 6-9 is not a quiet chapter in church history. It is bursting with movement, tension, courage, tragedy, and redemption. The gospel begins to break out of its original boundaries. Leadership expands. Persecution erupts. A martyr dies with a vision of Jesus. A persecutor meets Jesus in glory. The church is scattered - and through that scattering, the mission of God accelerates.\n\nStephen becomes the first Christian to die for his witness - and the way he dies becomes the seed of a global movement. This moment stands at the center of Acts 6-9. It is the place where suffering births mission, violence meets grace, a persecutor sees true faith for the first time, and a dying man resembles his Savior.",

      "content": "Stephen is not an apostle. He is not on a stage. He is not a priest or a trained scholar. He is a servant - and yet Acts describes him as full of faith, full of grace, full of power, and full of the Holy Spirit.\n\nHe performs signs and wonders. He speaks with wisdom that no one can refute. He becomes a living example that the Spirit can empower anyone, not just the original Twelve.\n\nAs the council condemns him, Stephen sees heaven open, the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. In Scripture, Jesus is usually seated - His work complete. Here, He stands. It is the posture of an advocate, a witness, an honor-bearer.\n\nStephen dies with his eyes fixed on Christ - and his final words echo Christ's own: 'Lord, receive my spirit.' 'Do not hold this sin against them.'",

      "content": "The early church included Hebraic Jews (native Aramaic-speaking Jews steeped in Judean culture) and Hellenistic Jews (Greek-speaking Jews shaped by broader Mediterranean culture). These groups had different languages, customs, and traditions - and tension was inevitable.\n\nWhen Greek-speaking widows felt neglected in the daily food distribution, the apostles responded with clarity and wisdom. They refused to neglect their calling to the ministry of the word and prayer, but elevated service to a Spirit-filled calling by insisting the church choose seven men full of the Spirit and wisdom. Practical ministry requires spiritual maturity. Serving tables is holy work when it is done in the name and power of the Spirit.\n\nAll seven appointed leaders have Greek names - meaning the marginalized group now has empowered leadership. The Spirit solves internal tension not by suppressing differences, but by redeeming them.",

      "content": "The early church grew through service meeting practical needs, suffering becoming a witness, and unexpected conversions like Saul's transforming enemies into chosen instruments.\n\nGod still grows His church through deacons and martyrs, administrators and evangelists. When we meet needs, we join Stephen and Philip in Spirit-filled ministry. Suffering may be the place where God shapes you most deeply."

And help me remember that no one - not even my fiercest opponent - is beyond the reach of Your grace. Make my life a spark for Your global mission. Amen."
