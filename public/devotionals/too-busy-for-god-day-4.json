Her calendar was driven by these fears, leaving no room for the fear of the Lord.\n\nThe revelation came during a crisis: What if I'm so afraid of human consequences that I've forgotten to fear divine ones?\n\nShe realized that proper fear of God actually liberates us from the tyranny of human fears. When we fear the right thing (God's displeasure), we're freed from fearing the wrong things (human opinion, temporal setbacks, finite losses).",
