You've made steady progress, connecting sections here and there, but much of it still looks like scattered pieces without clear meaning.\n\nThen one day, you find a crucial piece that suddenly makes a large section of the puzzle click into place. Patterns that were unclear become obvious, and you can see how dozens of other pieces fit together.\n\nThis is something like what happened when Jesus was born. For centuries, God's people had been collecting 'pieces' of divine revelation—promises to Abraham about blessing all nations, prophecies about a coming king from David's line, predictions about a suffering servant who would bear the sins of many, visions of a kingdom where justice and peace would reign forever.\n\nThe birth of Jesus was like finding that crucial puzzle piece that suddenly made the whole picture clear.",

How could one small nation bless the entire world? The angels' announcement that this birth brings 'good news for all the people' suggests Jesus's birth begins the fulfillment of this ancient promise.\n\n**The Davidic Covenant (1000 BC)**\nGod promised King David that his throne would be established forever (2 Samuel 7:12-16). The angel's announcement that the Savior is born 'in the town of David' and is 'the Messiah' suggests Jesus is the ultimate fulfillment of this promise.\n\n**The Prophetic Vision**\nIsaiah spoke of a time when 'the wolf will live with the lamb' (Isaiah 11:6-9). Jeremiah promised a 'new covenant' where God would write His law on people's hearts (Jeremiah 31:31-34). The angels' song of 'peace on earth' suggests Jesus's birth inaugurates this prophetic vision.",
