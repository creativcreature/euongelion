We celebrate the anointing of power, the anointing of purpose, the anointing for leadership. But James reveals something more tender — God's anointing as medicine for the wounded.\n\nOil in the ancient world wasn't just ceremonial. It was practical. Shepherds applied oil to their sheep's wounds. Physicians used it as ointment. The Good Samaritan poured oil on the beaten man's injuries. When James tells the church to anoint the sick with oil, he's invoking both the sacred and the medicinal — God's presence as healing balm.\n\nIsaiah 61 expands the picture: the Anointed One comes to bind up the brokenhearted, to comfort those who mourn, to give them 'a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning.' Notice the exchange — ashes for beauty, mourning for gladness. The anointing doesn't just treat symptoms; it transforms the entire condition.\n\nAnd Revelation 21:4 promises the final healing: 'He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore.' One day, no more pain — but even now, God is near to the brokenhearted.",
