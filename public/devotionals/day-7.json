AI threatening jobs, truth, meaning itself.\n\nDemocracy feels fragile. The economy feels rigged. The future feels canceled.\n\nOptimism says \"it'll all work out.\"\n\nBut you can't say that anymore with a straight face.\n\nThe doomers were right. The optimists were naive.\n\nSo what's left when optimism dies?",
