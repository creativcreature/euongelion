Jesus answered, 'Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.' Then they asked him, 'What must we do to do the works God requires?' Jesus answered, 'The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.'",

      "content": "Jesus begins by diagnosing the crowd's motivation. They are seeking him not because they understood the spiritual significance of his signs, but because he filled their stomachs. They were seeking physical satisfaction, not spiritual truth. Jesus calls them to shift their focus from 'food that spoils' to 'food that endures to eternal life.'\n\nThe crowd then asks a very religious-sounding question: 'What must we do to do the works God requires?' They are operating under a works-based mindset. They assume that their relationship with God is transactional — if they perform the right actions, God will reward them. This mindset is at the heart of every religion except for true Christianity. It is the belief that we can earn our way to God through our own efforts.\n\nJesus's answer is revolutionary. He shifts their focus from the plural 'works' to a singular 'work': 'The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.' The 'work' is to stop working and to trust in the finished work of another. It is to cease from our own striving and to rest in what God has done for us in Christ.\n\nThe focus is not on the quality or quantity of our faith, but on the object of our faith: 'the one he has sent.' This is the essence of the gospel. Salvation is not achieved by our works; it is received by our faith in the work of Christ.",

      "content": "Liam dreaded Thanksgiving. For him, it wasn't a day of gratitude; it was a day of performance. It was the annual family gathering where everyone implicitly compared their accomplishments from the past year. His older brother, a successful lawyer, would talk about his latest big case. His cousin would show off pictures of her new, bigger house. And Liam, a high school history teacher, would feel the familiar pressure to justify his life choices, to prove that his life was just as valuable, just as successful.\n\nThis year, the pressure felt even more intense. He had been passed over for a promotion, and his wife, Chloe, had recently decided to leave her corporate job to stay home with their young children — a decision that had put a strain on their finances. He felt like he was coming to the family feast with empty hands.\n\nLater that day, after the meal, Liam found himself in the quiet study, trying to escape the noise of the family gathering. He felt a deep sense of dissatisfaction, a spiritual hunger that the turkey and stuffing could not touch. He picked up an old Bible from the shelf and it fell open to the Gospel of John. His eyes landed on a passage where a crowd was following Jesus, not because of his message, but because he had miraculously fed them.\n\nThey asked Jesus, 'What must we do to do the works God requires?' Liam felt a pang of recognition. That was his question. What work did he have to do to prove his worth, to feel satisfied, to be enough?\n\nJesus's answer cut through the noise in his head: 'The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.'\n\nIt was so simple, so counterintuitive. The work was not to do more, but to believe. To trust. To rest. Liam realized he had been spending his whole life trying to perform the 'works' of God — getting the right job, the right house, the right reputation. He was just like the crowd, seeking the temporary bread of human approval instead of the lasting bread of divine acceptance.\n\nHe looked out the window at his children playing in the yard, at the setting sun casting a golden glow on the autumn leaves. For the first time that day, a genuine sense of gratitude began to well up in his heart — not for his accomplishments, but for the simple, unearned gift of his family, his faith, his life. The work was not to bring a perfect life to the feast. The work was simply to believe in the one who had invited him.",

      "content": "This is a timeless human tendency. We often pursue things that provide temporary satisfaction — wealth, success, approval, pleasure — while neglecting the deeper spiritual hunger of our souls. The crowd's works-based mindset was a misunderstanding of the Old Testament law itself. While the law contained many commands, its purpose was never to provide a means of earning salvation. Its purpose was to reveal God's holy character and to reveal humanity's sin and need for a savior.",

Jesus offers the same revolutionary answer: stop striving and believe."
