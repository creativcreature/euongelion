God made two great lights - the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning - the fourth day."

They were created to order our lives around a rhythm of remembrance, to call us back to the Creator at appointed times. The cosmos is a clock, and its primary function is to point us to God.\n\nEcclesiastes confirms this. God has built a sense of \"eternity\" into our hearts, a longing for a rhythm that transcends our daily lives. We were made to live in God's time.\n\nOn Day 4, God creates the celestial bodies. It's interesting that light was created on Day 1, but the sources of light (as we see them) are not created until Day 4. This has puzzled interpreters for centuries, but it highlights a key theological point: God is the source of light, not the sun. The sun is merely a lamp; God is the flame.\n\nThe primary purpose of these lights is to be \"signs to mark sacred times.\" The Hebrew word for \"sacred times\" is mo'adim, which refers to the appointed festivals and holy days in the Jewish calendar. The universe is a giant liturgical calendar, designed to call humanity to worship.\n\nEcclesiastes speaks to the human experience of time. We live in a world of seasons and cycles, but God has also placed \"eternity\" in our hearts. We have a deep, innate sense that there is more to life than the ticking of the clock. We were made for a rhythm that is both timely and timeless.\n\nJohn 9:4-5 reveals Jesus' own awareness of sacred time. He says, \"As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work. While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\" Jesus lived with an acute sense of divine timing. He knew His time on earth was limited, that there was a rhythm to His mission. Just as God created the sun and moon to mark sacred times, Jesus marked His own ministry with intentionality. He was the ultimate fulfillment of the mo'adim - the appointed time when God would dwell with His people. Every healing, every teaching, every moment was lived in the rhythm of the Father's will.",

      "body": "For the 33 miners trapped in the San Jose mine, time had lost all meaning. In the absolute darkness, 700 meters below the surface, there was no day or night. Their bodies, deprived of the natural rhythm of the sun, began to suffer. They had trouble sleeping, their moods fluctuated wildly, and a sense of disorientation was constant. They were not just trapped in space; they were trapped in a timeless void. The rescue team on the surface knew that to save the men's minds, they first had to restore their sense of time.\n\nThrough the narrow supply tubes, they sent down lights that were programmed to mimic the cycle of day and night. They would brighten in the \"morning\" and dim in the \"evening.\" They established a strict schedule for the miners: wake up, eat breakfast, do exercises, work in shifts to clear debris, eat lunch, talk to their families via video conference, eat dinner, and then \"sleep\" as the lights dimmed. They were creating an artificial rhythm, a man-made cosmos in the heart of the earth.\n\nThis new rhythm was a lifeline. It gave the men a sense of purpose and predictability in a world that had been utterly chaotic. The daily schedule became a ritual, a way of marking time that was not about survival, but about living. They were not just waiting for rescue; they were actively participating in their own preservation. The rescue team had recreated the fourth day of creation in the depths of the mine. They had given the men a sun and a moon, not just to see by, but to live by. They had restored the sacred rhythm that holds our lives together.",
