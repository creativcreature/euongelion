Not 'after the trouble ends' or 'if you handle the trouble perfectly,' but 'in me' - right in the middle of the storm. This suggests that abiding in Jesus isn't something we do when conditions are favorable; it's something we can do especially when conditions are harsh.\n\nThe storms of life don't have to disconnect us from Jesus.

      "body": "Maria was a nurse in the ICU during the height of the pandemic. Twelve-hour shifts became fourteen-hour marathons. She watched patients die alone, comforted grieving families through video calls, and went home each night emotionally and physically drained. Her usual quiet times with God disappeared under the weight of exhaustion and trauma.\n\nOne particularly brutal night, after losing three patients in a single shift, Maria found herself crying in a supply closet. In that moment of complete breakdown, she whispered, 'Jesus, I can't do devotions. I can't even pray properly. But I need You here with me right now.'\n\nWhat happened next surprised her. Instead of feeling guilty for her spiritual 'failure,' she sensed Jesus' presence more tangibly than she had in months. She realized that abiding wasn't about maintaining perfect spiritual practices - it was about staying connected to Jesus even when everything else fell apart.\n\n'I learned that storms don't disconnect me from the vine,' Maria later reflected. 'They just teach me that my connection doesn't depend on perfect conditions.'",

      "body": "Paul's experience with his 'thorn in the flesh' (2 Corinthians 12:7-10) provides a powerful example of abiding in difficulty rather than escaping it. Paul asked God three times to remove his thorn, but God's response was: 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.'\n\nPaul learned that God's presence wasn't contingent on the removal of problems but was available in the midst of them. In fact, Paul discovered that his weakness became the very place where God's strength was most evident. He concluded: 'Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.'\n\nThis teaches us that abiding in Jesus doesn't mean the absence of trouble but the presence of Jesus in our trouble.",
      "historicalContext": "In ancient viticulture, vines were often subjected to harsh conditions - drought, wind, and even controlled stress - to produce the best fruit. Farmers understood that vines grown in perfect conditions often produced inferior grapes, while vines that weathered storms developed deeper root systems and more concentrated flavors.",
