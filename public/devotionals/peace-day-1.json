Stay vigilant so you can protect what's yours.\n\nBut here's what no one tells you: **The more you try to control, the less peace you have.**\n\nBecause 2026 won't be controlled. Political violence. Civil unrest. 43% more anxious than last year. The chaos isn't slowing down.\n\nAnd your grip is exhausting you.",
