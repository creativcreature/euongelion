      "body": "Peter's sermon is the first Christian sermon in history, and it sets the pattern for gospel proclamation.\n\n1. The Gospel is rooted in Scripture: Peter quotes Joel and Psalms to show that Jesus fulfills God's long story. The gospel is not a new idea - it is the climax of God's plan.\n\n2. The Gospel confronts reality: Peter does not soften the truth: 'You crucified Him.' The gospel exposes sin so it can be healed, not hidden.\n\n3. The Gospel requires a response: The people ask, 'What shall we do?' The gospel is not just information. It is an invitation to transformation.\n\n4. The Gospel creates community: Repentance and baptism do not lead to isolation. They lead directly into the life of the church described in Acts 2:42-47.\n\n5. The Gospel opens the door for everyone: Peter ends with a promise: 'The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off - for all whom the Lord our God will call' (Acts 2:39). This includes the nations, the outcasts, the outsiders, and the wanderers.",

Some arrived ready to critique, but within hours felt something shift inside. Others came burdened by wounds from church conflicts or spiritual dryness, only to find their hearts stirred with unexpected clarity. It was not emotional manipulation. It was a calm conviction, the kind that comes when a community is so filled with prayer that people breathe in the atmosphere of God's presence without anyone trying to force it.\n\nOne traveler from Silesia wrote in his journal that he had planned to stay only a day. Instead, he stayed three weeks. What changed him was not a sermon or argument, but the way the people of Herrnhut loved one another with patience and humility. He said their unity 'laid open my heart' and exposed places he had ignored for years. Bitterness he had carried suddenly felt heavy. Habits he had justified felt hollow. He wrote, 'Their life was a sermon, and my heart was pierced.'\n\nAnother visitor, a young woman from Moravia, had grown numb to faith after years of exile and religious strife. When she arrived in Herrnhut, someone invited her to a simple evening prayer gathering. As she listened to men and women pray in their own words, she felt walls she had built begin to soften. She later described it as if 'the peace of God reached into the places I had locked away.' She wept quietly, not out of despair, but out of a conviction that she no longer needed to pretend.\n\nWhat touched them was not flawless people or perfect behavior. It was the unmistakable sense that God was at work among ordinary believers.",
