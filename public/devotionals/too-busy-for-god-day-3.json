Solomon observed that life has natural rhythms - seasons for different activities, emotions, and purposes. Fighting these seasons leads to frustration; flowing with them leads to fruitfulness.\n\nThe Hebrew word et doesn't just mean chronological time (chronos) but appointed time - the right moment for specific purposes. God operates by et, and wisdom means learning to recognize and respect these divine seasons.",

She pushed for promotion during budget cuts, launched new initiatives during transitions, and tried to have serious conversations during stressful seasons.\n\nHer mentor observed: 'You're planting in winter and wondering why nothing grows.'\n\nThe insight was devastating and liberating: What if the problem isn't what I'm doing, but when I'm doing it?",

But he kept missing kairos moments - divine appointments, family needs, spiritual opportunities that couldn't be scheduled.\n\nThe wake-up call came when his daughter said: 'Daddy, you're always busy when I need you.' He realized he was so focused on managing time that he was missing the times that mattered most.",
