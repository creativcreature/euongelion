        "text": "When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, 'Rabbi, when did you get here?' Jesus answered, 'Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.' Then they asked him, 'What must we do to do the works God requires?' Jesus answered, 'The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.' So they asked him, 'What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: He gave them bread from heaven to eat.' Jesus said to them, 'Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.' 'Sir,' they said, 'always give us this bread.' Then Jesus declared, 'I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.'"

      "body": "In verse 38, Jesus states his mission with perfect clarity: 'For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.' Jesus's entire life and ministry were characterized by a perfect submission to the will of the Father. This is the foundation of our confidence. Our salvation is not dependent on a fallible human will, but on the perfect, unwavering obedience of the Son of God.\n\nJesus then defines the Father's will in two parts, creating a divine bracket around the life of the believer that guarantees their eternal security.\n\nThe first part is the promise of preservation (v. 39a): 'that I shall lose none of all those he has given me.' This is a promise of divine keeping. The word for 'lose' is apollymi, the same word used for the 'spoiling' food in verse 27. It means 'to destroy' or 'to let perish.' Jesus promises that he will not allow any of his true sheep to perish. This directly addresses the fear that we might lose our salvation. Our security is not based on our ability to persevere, but on Christ's power to preserve us.\n\nThe second part is the promise of resurrection (v. 39b): 'but raise them up at the last day.' This is the ultimate fulfillment of salvation. It is not just about being forgiven in this life, but about being given a new, glorified, resurrected body in the life to come. The phrase 'the last day' refers to the final consummation of history, when Christ returns and brings his kingdom in its fullness. This promise anchors our hope not just in a past event (the cross) or a present reality (our relationship with Christ), but in a future certainty (our resurrection).\n\nIn verse 40, Jesus restates the will of the Father from our perspective. The condition is that 'everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him' — where 'looks to' (theoreo) implies more than a casual glance; it is a steady, focused gaze, a contemplation that leads to belief. The consequence is 'shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.' Eternal life is not just something we get when we die; it is a present possession. It is a quality of life, a participation in the life of God, that begins the moment we believe.",

His father came and stood beside him, holding two mugs of hot cider.\n\n'Your mother tells me you're a history teacher,' his father said, handing him a mug.\n\n'That's right,' Liam replied, surprised. He had been a history teacher for ten years, but he wasn't sure his father had ever really taken an interest.\n\n'I always thought that was... a waste of your potential,' his father admitted, his voice gruff. 'You were smart enough to be a lawyer, like your brother.'\n\nLiam braced himself for the familiar lecture. But it didn't come.\n\n'But watching you this weekend...' his father continued, staring into the fire. 'You seem... content. More content than Mark, with all his success. More content than me.'\n\nHe took a sip of his cider. 'This morning, I read that passage you showed me. The one about the bread of life. I kept reading. And I came to the part where Jesus talks about the will of the Father.'\n\nHe looked at Liam, his eyes searching. 'He says that it's God's will that he should lose none of those the Father has given him. That he will raise them up on the last day.'\n\n'That's right,' Liam said softly.\n\n'All my life,' his father said, his voice cracking slightly, 'I've been trying to build something that will last. A business, a legacy, a family. I've been trying to hold it all together, to make sure nothing gets lost. And I'm so tired. Because things always get lost. People leave. Businesses fail. Health fades. You can't hold on to anything.'\n\nHe looked at his hands, calloused from years of work. 'But this... this says that God is the one holding on. That if you belong to him, he will not lose you. That he will raise you up. That's a security you can't build, can't earn, can't buy.'\n\nLiam felt a lump in his throat. This was the conversation he had longed to have with his father his entire life.\n\n'No, Dad,' he said. 'You can't. It's a gift.'\n\n'A gift,' his father repeated, a sense of wonder in his voice. 'All this time, I've been trying to earn my place at the table, and he's just... giving it away.'\n\nThey stood in silence for a long time, watching the flames dance. The gap between them, a chasm of unspoken expectations and disappointments, seemed to be closing. They were just two men, a father and a son, standing before the fire, contemplating the profound, life-altering truth of a grace that holds on and never lets go.\n\nLiam realized that this was the true Thanksgiving. It wasn't about the food, or the family, or the performance. It was about this. It was about standing in the warmth of God's unwavering will, and knowing, with a deep and settled confidence, that you are secure. Not because of what you have done, but because of who is holding you.",

Ezekiel 34:11-12, 16 says, 'For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I myself will search for my sheep and look after them. As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered... I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak.'
