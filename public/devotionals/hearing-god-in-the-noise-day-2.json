      "content": "The apostle John warned early Christians to 'test the spirits' - in other words, don't assume every spiritual-sounding message is from God. In an age of podcasts, YouTube sermons, and social media prophets, this command is more relevant than ever.\n\nWe filter what we drink and even the music we listen to; how much more should we filter what we accept into our souls? The Bible gives us reliable filters:\n\n• Does the message agree with clear Scripture?\n• Does it exalt Jesus Christ as Lord and lead toward godliness?\n• Does it produce the fruit of the Spirit (love, peace, humility) or the works of the flesh (division, pride)?\n\nWe have an enemy who 'masquerades as an angel of light' (2 Corinthians 11:14), so some falsehoods come sugar-coated in religious language. The believers in Berea did this by 'examining the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true' (Acts 17:11). God doesn't mind our questions; He commends a faith that checks things out.",

      "content": "Jordan was excited about a new online Bible teacher he discovered. The speaker was dynamic and promised 'secret insights' into God's will. Jordan binge-watched the videos, eager to hear from God.\n\nBut soon he noticed something unsettling: this teacher rarely referenced the Bible directly and claimed personal revelations that sounded odd. One lesson left Jordan feeling uneasy - it didn't match what he knew of Jesus' character.\n\nWith a friend's encouragement, Jordan went back to Scripture (like the Bereans did in Acts 17:11) and prayed for wisdom. Sure enough, he found clear Bible passages that contradicted the teacher's claims. From then on, he committed to testing every teaching against the Bible's truth, no matter how appealing the style or how popular the messenger.",

She followed dozens of Christian influencers, each with their own interpretation of God's will.\n\nThe problem wasn't lack of spiritual input - it was lack of spiritual discernment. Lisa realized she was consuming more spiritual content than she was digesting. She was spiritually overfed but undernourished.\n\nThe solution came when she adopted the Berean principle: for every new teaching she encountered, she would spend equal time in Scripture, testing what she heard against what God had already clearly revealed.",
