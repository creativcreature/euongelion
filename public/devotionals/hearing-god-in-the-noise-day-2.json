The Bible gives us reliable filters:\n\n• Does the message agree with clear Scripture?\n• Does it exalt Jesus Christ as Lord and lead toward godliness?\n• Does it produce the fruit of the Spirit (love, peace, humility) or the works of the flesh (division, pride)?\n\nWe have an enemy who 'masquerades as an angel of light' (2 Corinthians 11:14), so some falsehoods come sugar-coated in religious language.

She followed dozens of Christian influencers, each with their own interpretation of God's will.\n\nThe problem wasn't lack of spiritual input - it was lack of spiritual discernment. Lisa realized she was consuming more spiritual content than she was digesting. She was spiritually overfed but undernourished.\n\nThe solution came when she adopted the Berean principle: for every new teaching she encountered, she would spend equal time in Scripture, testing what she heard against what God had already clearly revealed.",
      "historicalContext": "The first-century world was full of wandering teachers, philosophers, and spiritual gurus. Early Christians had to discern between apostles of Christ and the self-appointed 'super-apostles' who preached a different gospel (2 Corinthians 11:4-5,13). This is one reason the early church was careful to preserve the apostles' writings and form the New Testament canon - to have an authoritative measuring stick for truth.",
      "fascinatingFact": "In the early church, extensive oral Scripture reading was a necessity due to high illiteracy. Believers often heard the Word in gatherings and used that to filter any new teachings. Early Christians would even stand when Scripture was read, as a sign that 'this is the authority.'",
