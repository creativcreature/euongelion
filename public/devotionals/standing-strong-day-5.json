What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ — the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith."

Paul chose this deliberately vulgar term to shock his readers into understanding the magnitude of the comparison: everything that once defined his worth is garbage compared to knowing Christ.",
      "usageNote": "Paul was not saying his achievements were evil, only that they were utterly insufficient as a basis for identity or righteousness. The contrast is between skybala (garbage) and the 'surpassing worth' (hyperechon) of knowing Christ. It is the most extreme comparison Paul could make.",

The resume that once defined him — circumcised on the eighth day, tribe of Benjamin, Pharisee of Pharisees, zealous persecutor of the church — now appears in the loss column of his spiritual ledger.\n\nThis is not the mild indifference of someone who has outgrown old interests. Paul uses the word skybala: garbage, refuse, dung. His former achievements aren't just less valuable than Christ. They are worthless in comparison. Not because they were sinful, but because they were insufficient. A gold medal cannot define a soul.\n\nThe phrase 'surpassing worth of knowing Christ' reveals what filled the vacuum. Paul didn't trade something for nothing. He traded lesser treasure for infinitely greater treasure. True righteousness comes not from performance but from faith. When we stop trying to earn God's approval through achievement, we discover we already have it through Christ.",
