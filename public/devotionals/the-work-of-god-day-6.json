        "text": "When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, 'Rabbi, when did you get here?' Jesus answered, 'Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.' Then they asked him, 'What must we do to do the works God requires?' Jesus answered, 'The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.' So they asked him, 'What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: He gave them bread from heaven to eat.' Jesus said to them, 'Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.' 'Sir,' they said, 'always give us this bread.' Then Jesus declared, 'I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.'"

We have examined the historical reliability of the Gospels, wrestled with the identity of Jesus, explored the nature of belief, and counted the cost of discipleship. This week, we have focused on the most personal aspect of the gospel: Jesus as the Bread of Life, the one who satisfies our deepest hunger and secures our eternal destiny.\n\nHere is a summary of the journey through John 6:25-40 this week:\n\nDay 1 established the foundation: the 'work of God' is not religious performance but simple, profound belief in the one he has sent. The crowd asked about 'works' (plural), but Jesus pointed them to a single 'work' (singular): trust.\n\nDay 2 explored the distinction between shadow and reality: the manna was a temporary, physical sign; Jesus is the true bread from heaven. We learned to stop settling for 'food that spoils' and to hunger for the bread that gives life to the world.\n\nDay 3 brought us to the heart of the passage: Jesus's declaration, 'I am the bread of life.' This first 'I am' statement is a claim to divine identity and a promise of complete, permanent satisfaction for all who come and believe.\n\nDay 4 confronted us with the divine tension: the Father sovereignly gives believers to the Son, and the Son will never drive away anyone who comes. We learned to embrace the paradox as a comfort, not a contradiction.\n\nDay 5 revealed the unshakable foundation: the Father's will. Jesus's mission is to lose none and to raise all on the last day. Our security rests not on our grip, but on God's.\n\nToday, we bring it all to a close with the only fitting response: eucharistia — thanksgiving. Gratitude is the natural, spontaneous, and continuous response of a heart that has understood the gospel.\n\nWe are thankful for the work of God — that he has done for us what we could not do for ourselves. We are thankful for the Bread of Life — that he has satisfied our deepest hunger with himself. We are thankful for the sovereignty of the Father — that he has chosen us and drawn us to himself.

Liam stood on the porch, watching the cars pull out of the driveway. This year, there was no sense of relief that the performance was over. Instead, there was a quiet sense of peace, of fullness.\n\nHis father came and stood beside him. 'It was a good Thanksgiving,' he said. It wasn't a question, but a statement. A simple, heartfelt declaration.\n\n'It was,' Liam agreed.\n\n'That thing you said,' his father began, his voice hesitant. 'About the work of God being to believe. About him holding on to us. I've been thinking about it all weekend.'\n\nHe looked at Liam, and for the first time, Liam saw not a powerful CEO or a demanding father, but a man who was simply hungry for hope.\n\n'I've spent my whole life building my own kingdom,' his father said. 'And it's empty. There's no real bread there. I think... I think I'm ready to try a different kind of bread.'\n\nLiam's heart swelled with a gratitude so intense it almost hurt. It was a moment he had prayed for his entire life, but it was happening in a way he never could have planned. It wasn't a dramatic conversion, but a quiet, humble turning. A hungry soul asking for the bread of life.\n\nLater that night, after everyone had gone, Liam and Chloe sat by the fire, the house quiet around them. 'It was a good Thanksgiving,' Chloe said, echoing his father's words.\n\n'The best,' Liam replied.\n\nHe thought about the journey of the past eight weeks. He had started as a skeptic, armed with questions and doubts. He had demanded evidence, wrestled with hard truths, and counted the cost. He had followed the story from the wilderness of Judea to the shores of Galilee, from the cross to the empty tomb.\n\nAnd somewhere along the way, the story had become his own. The historical Jesus had become his living Lord. The intellectual belief had become a life-transforming trust. The hunger for approval had been replaced by the deep, satisfying fullness of grace.\n\nHe was no longer the man who dreaded Thanksgiving, the man who came to the feast with empty hands, hoping to scrounge for scraps of validation. He was a man who knew he was invited to the table, not because of what he brought, but because of the one who was the feast itself.\n\nHe looked at his wife, at the warm glow of the fire, at the peaceful home that was a gift of grace. He was filled with a profound sense of eucharistia. Thanksgiving. Not just for a day, but for a lifetime. Not just for the temporary manna of earthly blessings, but for the true, eternal, life-giving Bread of Life.",

Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind, for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.' This is the perfect summary of our journey. We have seen God's unfailing love and his wonderful deeds in the person of Jesus Christ.

This connects directly to John 6 — Jesus, the Bread of Life, gives himself so that the world might have life.",
