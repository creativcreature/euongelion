They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.",

      "content": "1. Awe - A Heart Awake to God: Awe is not spiritual fireworks. It is awareness. It is what happens when prayer, Word, and community shift from duty to desire. The early church was not impressed with themselves. They were impressed with God.\n\n2. Wonders and Signs - God's Activity, Not Human Effort: Miracles in Acts serve a purpose: they validate the apostles' message, they confirm Jesus is alive and reigning, they demonstrate the nearness of the Kingdom. We don't control the miraculous, but we can create space for God to move.\n\n3. Generosity - The Economics of a Kingdom People: The early believers viewed what they owned as held in trust for God. This wasn't forced. It wasn't socialism. It was Spirit-led surrender. Generosity is not measured by amount, but by availability.\n\n4. Daily Faithfulness - Slow, Steady Formation: Notice the rhythm: daily gatherings, daily meals, daily worship, daily favor, daily additions. Faith grows through small, consistent habits more than rare mountaintop moments.\n\n5. Joy - The Emotional Shape of a Spirit-Filled Life: Gladness and simplicity of heart were not personality traits. They were the emotional fruit of a community grounded in grace, forgiveness, and shared life. Joy becomes possible when you stop living alone.",

      "content": "By the mid-1700s, the transformation in Herrnhut was visible even to outsiders. Travelers passing through the village often wrote in their journals that there was 'a strange warmth' in the air, as if the peace of the community itself testified. What had once been a fractured settlement now had a quiet, compelling beauty about it - a sense that God was tangibly present. It was, in its own way, a place of awe.\n\nTheir generosity became legendary. When fires broke out in neighboring villages, the Moravians arrived first with food, tools, and labor. When refugees from Poland and Bohemia fled oppression, Herrnhut opened its doors without hesitation. People gave freely, not because they were wealthy, but because they had learned that possessions were resources entrusted by God for the sake of others.\n\nHospitality marked their days. Doors were open. Meals were shared. Strangers were welcomed. The line between 'my home' and 'our home' blurred, not from pressure, but from joy. They believed that if Christ dwelled among them, so should His welcome.\n\nAnd joy - deep, steady, disarming joy - became their signature. Not shallow cheerfulness. Not denial of suffering. A rooted gladness that grew from prayer, repentance, shared life, and trust in God. Visitors often commented that Herrnhut's singing could be heard from miles away.\n\nWhat began as a divided settlement became a living portrait of Acts 2. Awe, generosity, unity, joy, and daily worship - not manufactured, but cultivated by the Spirit through ordinary people who chose to surrender. From this unlikely village came missionaries, prayer movements, worship traditions, and a global witness that rippled for centuries.",
