The Hebrew suggests that hasty feet - rapid movement without wisdom - actually slows down progress toward the goal.\n\nThe wise person moves deliberately, not desperately. They pause to gain da'at (knowledge) before taking action. This isn't procrastination; it's precision.",

His calendar was packed with rapid-fire meetings, instant responses, and immediate action items.\n\nBut his hasty feet kept missing the way. The rushed hire who didn't work out. The quick investment that lost money. The immediate response that damaged a relationship. The fast decision that required months to undo.\n\nHis mentor asked a simple question: 'What if wisdom moves slower than ambition?'",

The pressure to decide quickly often prevents us from gaining the da'at necessary for wise choices."
