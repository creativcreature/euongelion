In an instant, her head struck the bottom, snapping her neck and crushing her spinal cord. She became a quadriplegic, paralyzed from the shoulders down.\n\nThe active teenager who loved horseback riding, tennis, and art was now completely dependent on others for every basic need. Her plans for college, career, and an active life shattered in a single moment.\n\nProverbs 3:5 commands us to trust the Lord with all our hearts and to stop leaning on our own understanding. But this is easiest to read and hardest to live when your understanding has completely failed you. When every plan you made lies in pieces, and every assumption about what constitutes a meaningful life has been stripped away.\n\nThe Hebrew word batach describes the kind of security you feel within fortified city walls. It is not passive belief but active refuge-seeking. And the prohibition against leaning on our own understanding uses the image of supporting yourself on a broken staff. When life breaks, we discover what we were truly leaning on all along.",

It can mislead us when it contradicts God's revealed truth. Joni initially leaned on her own understanding of what a meaningful life required: mobility, independence, an active body.
