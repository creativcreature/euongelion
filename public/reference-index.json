It was also the war in which he sustained a near\r\nfatal injury to his sciatic nerve.

However, we know he\r\nwas educated both at home and by his parish priest whose first name was\r\nLawrence and who was greatly admired by the young Nicolas. He was well\r\nread and, from an early age, drawn to a spiritual life of faith and love\r\nfor God.\r\n\r\nWe also know that in the years between the abrupt end of his duties as\r\na soldier and his entry into monastic life, he spent a period of time\r\nin the wilderness living like one of the early desert fathers.

We\r\nought to give ourselves up to God with regard both to things temporal\r\nand spiritual and seek our satisfaction only in the fulfilling of His\r\nwill. Whether God led us by suffering or by consolation all would be\r\nequal to a soul truly resigned.\r\n\r\nHe said we need fidelity in those disruptions in the ebb and flow of\r\nprayer when God tries our love to Him.

We\r\nwould especially mention as an instance the doctrine of justification\r\nthrough the imputed righteousness of Christ. Some of the expressions of\r\nCalvin on the subject of reprobation may be regarded as too unqualified,\r\nand we can no further endorse them than as they are incorporated in the\r\nPresbyterian Confession of Faith. The most decidedly objectionable feature\r\nin the “Christian Institutes,” is to be found in the explanation of the\r\nFourth Commandment, where the author asserts the abrogation of the\r\nSabbath. In Calvin’s view, this ordinance was a mere type of better\r\nblessings, and, with the types and ceremonies of the old dispensation, was\r\ndone away by the introduction of a new and better dispensation.

Of\r\nthis consternation we have frequent examples in the Judges and Prophets;\r\nso that it was a common expression among the Lord’s people—“We shall die,\r\nbecause we have seen God.”(62) Therefore the history of Job, to humble men\r\nwith a consciousness of their pollution, impotence, and folly, derives its\r\nprincipal argument from a description of the Divine purity, power, and\r\nwisdom.

By the word\r\n_subsistence_ we mean something different from the word _essence_.

But because he could not be _with God_, without\r\nsubsisting in the Father, hence arises that subsistence, which, although\r\ninseparably connected with the essence, has a peculiar mark, by which it\r\nis distinguished from it. Now, I say that each of the three subsistences\r\nhas a relation to the others, but is distinguished from them by a peculiar\r\nproperty.

And Augustine himself, in his fifth book against Julian,\r\ncontends very largely, that sins proceed not only from the permission or\r\nthe prescience, but from the power of God, in order that former sins may\r\nthereby be punished. So also what they advance concerning permission is\r\ntoo weak to be supported.

For which\r\nreason the Apostle says that the death of Christ effected “the redemption\r\nof the transgressions that were under the first testament.”(817) The\r\nApostle, therefore, justly denominates the ceremonies “a hand‐writing\r\nagainst those who observe them;” because by them they publicly attested\r\ntheir condemnation and impurity.

Nevertheless, they perish through their\r\nown iniquity, and not through the unjust hatred of God. Nor is there any\r\nroom left for expostulation, why they are not assisted by Divine grace to\r\nobtain salvation as well as others. Since it is a punishment, therefore,\r\ninflicted on the impious and flagitious, in consequence of their\r\ntransgressions, that their families remain destitute of Divine grace for\r\nmany generations, who can bring any accusation against God for this most\r\nrighteous instance of his vengeance? But it will be said, the Lord\r\ndeclares, on the contrary, that the punishment of the sin of the father\r\nshall not be transferred to the son. Observe the subject that is treated\r\nof in that place. The Israelites, after they had been long harassed by\r\nnumerous and unceasing calamities, began to use this proverb, “The fathers\r\nhave eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge;”(840) by\r\nwhich they insinuated, that...","keywords":["let","inquire","whether","punishment","inconsistent","the","divine","justice","whole","nature","man","worthy","condemnation","know","destruction","awaits","those","who","are","not"],"scriptureRefs":[],"priority":5,"wordCount":198},{"id":"ref:content/reference/commentaries/calvin/institutes-of-the-christian-religion-vol1.txt:342","source":"content/reference/commentaries/calvin/institutes-of-the-christian-religion-vol1.txt","sourceType":"commentary","title":"calvin — Institutes Of The Christian Religion Vol1","content":"XXI.

Now, since we understand it to be the will of the Lord, that we\r\nshould reverence his name in our oaths, we ought to use so much the more\r\ncaution, lest, instead of reverence, they betray dishonour or contempt of\r\nit. It is no trifling insult to him, when perjury is committed in his\r\nname; and therefore the law calls it a profanation.(848) But what remains\r\nto the Lord, when he is despoiled of his truth? he will then cease to be\r\nGod. But he is certainly despoiled of it, when he is made an abettor and\r\napprover of a falsehood. Wherefore, when Joshua would induce Achan to a\r\nconfession of the truth, he says, “My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the\r\nLord God of Israel;”(849) implying in this that the Lord is grievously\r\ndishonoured, if perjury be committed in his name. Nor is this strange; for\r\nin such a case we do all that is in our power to brand his sacred name\r\nwith a falsehood. And that this form of expression was customary among the\r\nJews, whenever any man was called to take an oath, appears from a similar\r\nadjuration used by the Pharisees in the Gospel of John.(850) To this\r\ncaution we are accustomed by the forms of oaths which are used in the\r\nScriptures: “The Lord liv...","keywords":["xxiv","now","since","understand","the","lord","reverence","his","name","our","oaths","ought","use","much","caution","lest","instead","betray","dishonour","contempt"],"scriptureRefs":[],"priority":5,"wordCount":224},{"id":"ref:content/reference/commentaries/calvin/institutes-of-the-christian-religion-vol1.txt:346","source":"content/reference/commentaries/calvin/institutes-of-the-christian-religion-vol1.txt","sourceType":"commentary","title":"calvin — Institutes Of The Christian Religion Vol1","content":"we are guilty of manifest impiety; because we thereby transfer to them the\r\nglory due to the Deity.

For this reason Paul says, that the love which God had for us before\r\nthe creation of the world, was founded on Christ.(1250) This doctrine is\r\nclear, and consistent with the Scripture, and admirably reconciles the\r\ndifferent passages, where it is said, that God manifested his love to us\r\nby the gift of his only begotten Son,(1251) and yet that he was our enemy\r\ntill he was reconciled by the death of Christ.(1252) But for a further\r\nconfirmation of it, to such as require the testimony of the ancient\r\nChurch, I will cite a passage from Augustine, which expressly maintains\r\nthe same. “The love of God,” says he, “is incomprehensible and immutable.\r\nFor he did not begin to love us when we were reconciled to him by the\r\nblood of his Son, but he loved us before the creation of the world, that\r\nwe might be his children, together with his only begotten Son, even before\r\nwe had any existence.

Now, in answer to the inquiry, how Christ, by the abolition of our\r\nsins, has destroyed the enmity between God and us, and procured a\r\nrighteousness to render him favourable and propitious to us, it may be\r\nreplied in general, that he accomplished it for us by the whole course of\r\nhis obedience. This is proved by the testimony of Paul. “As by one man’s\r\ndisobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many\r\nbe made righteous.”(1254) And indeed in another place he extends the cause\r\nof the pardon, which exempts us from the malediction of the law, to the\r\nwhole life of Christ. “When the fulness of the time was come, God sent\r\nforth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that\r\nwere under the law.”(1255) Thus he himself affirmed even his baptism to be\r\na branch of his righteousness, because he acted in obedience to the\r\ncommand of the Father.(1256) In short, from the time of his assuming the\r\ncharacter of a servant, he began to pay the price of our deliverance in\r\norder to redeem us.

And it was no\r\nmean specimen of his incomparable love to us, to contend with horrible\r\nfear, and amid those dreadful torments to neglect all care of himself,\r\nthat he might promote our benefit. Indeed we must admit, that it was\r\nimpossible for God to be truly appeased in any other way, than by Christ\r\nrenouncing all concern for himself, and submitting and devoting himself\r\nentirely to his will. On this subject the apostle appositely cites the\r\ntestimony of the Psalmist: “Then said I, Lo, I come; in the volume of the\r\nbook it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law\r\nis within my heart.”(1268) But since terrified consciences find no rest\r\nbut in a sacrifice and ablution to expiate their sins, we are properly\r\ndirected thither, and the death of Christ is exhibited to us as the source\r\nof life.

If Christ had merely died a corporeal death, no end\r\nwould have been accomplished by it; it was requisite, also, that he should\r\nfeel the severity of the Divine vengeance, in order to appease the wrath\r\nof God, and satisfy his justice. Hence it was necessary for him to contend\r\nwith the powers of hell and the horror of eternal death. We have already\r\nstated from the prophet, that “the chastisement of our peace was upon\r\nhim,” that “he was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our\r\niniquities;”(1293) the meaning of which is, that he was made a substitute\r\nand surety for transgressors, and even treated as a criminal himself, to\r\nsustain all the punishments which would have been inflicted on them; only\r\nwith this exception, that “it was not possible that he should be holden of\r\nthe pains of death.”(1294) Therefore it is no wonder, if he be said to\r\nhave descended into hell, since he suffered that death which the wrath of\r\nGod inflic...","keywords":["but","laying","aside","all","consideration","the","creed","seek","for","certain","explanation","descent","christ","hell","and","find","one","divine","word","not"],"scriptureRefs":[],"priority":5,"wordCount":211},{"id":"ref:content/reference/commentaries/calvin/institutes-of-the-christian-religion-vol1.txt:464","source":"content/reference/commentaries/calvin/institutes-of-the-christian-religion-vol1.txt","sourceType":"commentary","title":"calvin — Institutes Of The Christian Religion Vol1","content":"XI.

Hence faith receives many advantages. For it perceives, that by his\r\nascension the Lord has opened the way to the kingdom of heaven, which had\r\nbeen stopped by Adam.

This distinction is gathered from numerous passages of Scripture. “God\r\nso loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever\r\nbelieveth in him should not perish.”(1341) We see that the love of God\r\nholds the first place, as the supreme and original cause, and that faith\r\nin Christ follows as the second and proximate cause. If it be objected,\r\nthat Christ is only the formal cause, this diminishes his merit more than\r\nthe words now quoted will bear. For if we obtain righteousness by a faith\r\nwhich relies on him, it is in him we are to seek the cause of our\r\nsalvation. This is evident from many passages. “Not that we loved God, but\r\nthat he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our\r\nsins.”(1342) These words clearly demonstrate, that to remove every\r\nobstacle in the way of his love towards us, God appointed a method of\r\nreconciliation in Christ. And there is much contained in the word\r\n“propitiation;” for God, in a certain ineffable manner, at the same time\r\nthat he loved us, was nevertheless angry with us, till he was reconciled\r\nin Christ.

Now, that Christ by his obedience has really procured and merited\r\ngrace from the Father for us, is certainly and justly concluded from\r\nvarious passages of Scripture.

But according to the\r\ntestimony of Paul, “We were reconciled by his death, by whom we have\r\nreceived the atonement,” or reconciliation.(1349) Now, there is no room\r\nfor reconciliation without a previous offence. The sense therefore is,\r\nthat God, to whom our sins had rendered us odious, has been appeased by\r\nthe death of his Son, so as to be propitious to us.

For the same reason also Paul,\r\nwhen speaking of purification and justification, says, we enjoy both “in\r\nthe name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.”(1395) The sum\r\nof all is this—that the Holy Spirit is the bond by which Christ\r\nefficaciously unites us to himself. And what we have advanced in the last\r\nbook concerning his unction, tends to establish the same truth.\r\n\r\nII. But as a further confirmation of this point, which is highly worthy of\r\nbeing understood, we must remember that Christ was endued with the Holy\r\nSpirit in a peculiar manner; in order to separate us from the world, and\r\nintroduce us into the hope of an eternal inheritance. Hence the Spirit is\r\ncalled “the Spirit of holiness;”(1396) not only because he animates and\r\nsupports us by that general power which is displayed in mankind, and in\r\nall other creatures, but because he is the seed and root of a heavenly\r\nlife within us. The principal topic, therefore, dwelt on by the prophets\r\nin celebrating the kingdom of Christ, is, that there would then be a more\r\nexuberant effusion of the Spirit.

So, where he wishes\r\nto the faithful “the grace of Christ, and the love of God,” he adds also\r\n“the communion of the Spirit,”(1403) without which there can be no\r\nenjoyment of the paternal favour of God, or the beneficence of Christ.

For, if God\r\npromises any thing, he gives a proof of his benevolence; so that there is\r\nno promise of his which is not a testimony of his love. Nor does it affect\r\nthe argument, that the impious, when they are loaded with great and\r\ncontinual benefits from the Divine goodness, render themselves obnoxious\r\nto a heavier judgment.

But before we proceed any further, it will be useful to amplify and\r\nexplain the definition we have given; in which there are three points to\r\nbe particularly considered. In the first place, when we call repentance “a\r\nconversion of the life to God,” we require a transformation, not only in\r\nthe external actions, but in the soul itself; which, after having put off\r\nits old nature, should produce the fruits of actions corresponding to its\r\nrenovation. The prophet, intending to express this idea, commands those\r\nwhom he calls to repentance, to make themselves a new heart.(1623)\r\nWherefore Moses, when about to show how the Israelites might repent and be\r\nrightly converted to the Lord, frequently teaches them that it must be\r\ndone with all their heart, and with all their soul; and by speaking of the\r\ncircumcision of the heart, he enters into the inmost affections of the\r\nmind. This mode of expression we find often repeated by the prophets; but\r\nthere is no passage from which we may obtain clearer ideas of the true\r\nnature of repentance, than from the language of God in the fourth chapter\r\nof Jeremiah: “If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, return unto\r\nme.

In the second place, we represented repentance as proceeding from a\r\nserious fear of God. For before the mind of a sinner can be inclined to\r\nrepentance, it must be excited by a knowledge of the Divine judgment. But\r\nwhen this thought has once been deeply impressed, that God will one day\r\nascend his tribunal to exact an account of all words and actions, it will\r\nnot permit the miserable man to take any interval of rest, or to enjoy\r\neven a momentary respite, but perpetually stimulates him to adopt a new\r\ncourse of life, that he may be able to appear with security at that\r\njudgment. Wherefore the Scripture, when it exhorts to repentance,\r\nfrequently introduces a mention of the judgment; as in Jeremiah; “Lest my\r\nfury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of\r\nthe evil of your doings:”(1626) in the address of Paul to the Athenians;\r\n“The times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men\r\nevery where to repent; because he hath appointed a day in which he will\r\njudge the world in righteousness:”(1627) and in many other places.\r\nSometimes, by the punishments already inflicted, it declares that God is a\r\njudge; in order that sinners may consi...","keywords":["vii","the","second","place","represented","repentance","proceeding","serious","fear","god","for","mind","sinner","can","inclined","must","excited","knowledge","divine","judgment"],"scriptureRefs":[],"priority":5,"wordCount":211},{"id":"ref:content/reference/commentaries/calvin/institutes-of-the-christian-religion-vol1.txt:538","source":"content/reference/commentaries/calvin/institutes-of-the-christian-religion-vol1.txt","sourceType":"commentary","title":"calvin — Institutes Of The Christian Religion Vol1","content":"VIII. It remains for us, in the third place, to explain our position, that\r\nrepentance consists of two parts—the mortification of the flesh and the\r\nvivification of the spirit. This is clearly expressed by the prophets,\r\nalthough in a simple and homely manner, according to the capacity of a\r\ncarnal people, when they say, “Depart from evil, and do good.”(1629)\r\nAgain: “Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from\r\nbefore mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgment;\r\nrelieve the oppressed,” &c.(1630) For when they call men from the paths of\r\nwickedness, they require the total destruction of the flesh, which is full\r\nof wickedness and perverseness. It is a thing truly difficult and arduous\r\nto put off ourselves, and to depart from the native bias of our minds. Nor\r\nmust the flesh be considered as entirely dead, unless all that we have of\r\nourselves be destroyed.

Concerning the other species of confession, Christ says, in the\r\nGospel of Matthew, “If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there\r\nrememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leave there thy gift\r\nbefore the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and\r\nthen come and offer thy gift.”(1712) Thus is that charity, which has been\r\nbroken by our offence, to be repaired by acknowledging the fault we have\r\ncommitted, and imploring forgiveness. In this kind is comprehended the\r\nconfession of those who have sinned to the offence of the whole Church.\r\nFor, if Christ esteems the private offence of one man of such importance,\r\nas to prohibit from the sacred ordinances all those who have sinned\r\nagainst their brethren till they have been restored to favour by an\r\nadequate satisfaction,—how much stronger is the reason, that he who, by\r\nany evil example, has injured the whole Church, should reconcile it to\r\nhimself by an acknowledgment of his guilt!

And the principle of that doctrine is this—that it\r\nis the duty of believers to “present their bodies a living sacrifice,\r\nholy, acceptable unto God;”(1826) and that in this consists the legitimate\r\nworship of him. Hence is deduced an argument for exhorting them, “Be not\r\nconformed to this world; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your\r\nmind, that ye may prove what is that will of God.” This is a very\r\nimportant consideration, that we are consecrated and dedicated to God;\r\nthat we may not hereafter think, speak, meditate, or do any thing but with\r\na view to his glory.

The same apostle, in another place, gives a more distinct, though a\r\nbrief, representation of all the parts of a well‐regulated life. “The\r\ngrace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching\r\nus, that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,\r\nrighteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed\r\nhope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus\r\nChrist, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all\r\niniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good\r\nworks.”(1829) For after having proposed the grace of God to animate us, in\r\norder to prepare the way for us truly to worship God, he removes two\r\nobstacles, which are our chief impediments; first, ungodliness, to which\r\nwe have naturally too strong a propensity, and secondly, worldly lusts,\r\nwhich extend themselves further.

Thus, when it is said, that the\r\npublican “went down to his house justified,”(1890) we cannot say that he\r\nobtained righteousness by any merit of works. The meaning therefore is,\r\nthat after he had obtained the pardon of his sins, he was considered as\r\nrighteous in the sight of God.

But since Osiander has introduced I know not what monstrous notion of\r\nessential righteousness, by which, though he had no intention to destroy\r\njustification by grace, yet he has involved it in such obscurity as\r\ndarkens pious minds, and deprives them of a serious sense of the grace of\r\nChrist,—it will be worth while, before I pass to any thing else, to refute\r\nthis idle notion.

In this confusion of two blessings which\r\nOsiander obtrudes on us, there is a similar absurdity. For as God actually\r\nrenews to the practice of righteousness those whom he gratuitously accepts\r\nas righteous, Osiander confounds that gift of regeneration with this\r\ngracious acceptance, and contends that they are one and the same.

This Isaiah has beautifully expressed in the\r\nfollowing words: “The Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save;\r\nneither is his ear heavy, that it cannot hear; but your iniquities have\r\nseparated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from\r\nyou, that he will not hear.”(1953) We are informed, that sin makes a\r\ndivision between man and God, and turns the Divine countenance away from\r\nthe sinner. Nor can it be otherwise; because it is incompatible with his\r\nrighteousness to have any communion with sin.

Both these points are fully established by the language of Paul,\r\nwhich I have already recited. “God was in Christ, reconciling the world\r\nunto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed\r\nunto us the word of reconciliation.”(1955) Then he adds the substance of\r\nhis ministry: “He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we\r\nmight be made the righteousness of God in him.”(1956) The terms\r\n“righteousness” and “reconciliation” are here used by him\r\nindiscriminately, to teach us that they are mutually comprehended in each\r\nother. And he states the manner of obtaining this righteousness to consist\r\nin our transgressions not being imputed to us. Wherefore we can no longer\r\ndoubt how God justifies, when we hear that he reconciles us to himself by\r\nnot imputing our sins to us. Thus, in the Epistle to the Romans, the\r\napostle proves, that “God imputeth righteousness without works,” from the\r\ntestimony of David, who declares, “Blessed are they whose iniquities are\r\nforgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord\r\nwill not impute sin.”(1957) By “blessedness,” in this passage, he\r\nundoubtedly means righteousness; for since h...","keywords":["xxii","both","points","are","fully","established","the","language","paul","already","recited","god","was","christ","reconciling","world","unto","himself","not","imputing"],"scriptureRefs":[],"priority":5,"wordCount":198},{"id":"ref:content/reference/commentaries/calvin/institutes-of-the-christian-religion-vol1.txt:673","source":"content/reference/commentaries/calvin/institutes-of-the-christian-religion-vol1.txt","sourceType":"commentary","title":"calvin — Institutes Of The Christian Religion Vol1","content":"XXIII. Hence, also, it is evident, that we obtain justification before\r\nGod, solely by the intervention of the righteousness of Christ. Which is\r\nequivalent to saying, that a man is righteous, not in himself, but because\r\nthe righteousness of Christ is communicated to him by imputation; and this\r\nis a point which deserves an attentive consideration. For it supersedes\r\nthat idle notion, that a man is justified by faith, because faith receives\r\nthe Spirit of God by whom he is made righteous; which is too repugnant to\r\nthe foregoing doctrine, ever to be reconcilable to it. For he must\r\ncertainly be destitute of all righteousness of his own, who is taught to\r\nseek a righteousness out of himself. This is most clearly asserted by the\r\napostle, when he says, “He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no\r\nsin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”(1960) We see\r\nthat our righteousness is not in ourselves, but in Christ; and that all\r\nour title to it rests solely on our being partakers of Christ; for in\r\npossessing him, we possess all his riches with him.

Thus is accomplished\r\nthat remarkable prophecy of Zechariah: “I will remove the iniquity of that\r\nland in one day.

A reference to the most\r\n      able and intelligent theologians and preachers who have held those\r\n      principles, and upon whom they may reasonably be concluded to have\r\n      exerted their genuine and fullest influence, will amply evince the\r\n      inaccuracy of this representation.

In his Sophomore\r\nyear he made the acquaintance of Locke's _Essay on the Human\r\nUnderstanding_--a work which left a permanent impress on his thinking. He\r\nread it, he says, with a far higher pleasure \"than the most greedy miser\r\nfinds when gathering up handfuls of silver and gold from some\r\nnewly-discovered treasure.\" Under its influence he began a series of Notes\r\non the Mind, with a view to a comprehensive treatise on mental philosophy.\r\nHe also began, possibly somewhat later, a series of Notes on Natural\r\nScience, with reference to a similar work on natural philosophy. It is in\r\nthese early writings that we find the outlines of an idealistic theory\r\nwhich resembles, but was probably not at all derived from, that of\r\nBerkeley, and which seems to have remained a determining factor in his\r\nspeculations to the last.[2]\r\n\r\nAfter graduating he continued to reside for two years in New Haven,\r\nstudying for the ministry.

And he to me, 'Ere the shore allows thee to see it\r\nthou shalt be satisfied; it will be fitting that thou enjoy such a\r\ndesire.'

It was his favorite among all the Biblical books. In his\r\ntable talks the saying is recorded: “The Epistle to the Galatians is\r\nmy epistle. To it I am as it were in wedlock. It is my Katherine.” Much\r\nlater when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his Latin\r\nworks, he remarked to his home circle: “If I had my way about it\r\nthey would republish only those of my books which have doctrine. My\r\nGalatians, for instance.” The lectures which are preserved in the works\r\nherewith submitted to the American public were delivered in 1531.

Its exact\r\ndate and its authorship are still a matter of debate. Manuscripts of\r\nthe Latin version survive in considerable numbers all over Western\r\nEurope, and they, with the vast list of translations and of printed\r\neditions, testify to its almost unparalleled popularity. One scribe\r\nattributes it to St. Bernard of Clairvaux; but the fact that it\r\ncontains a quotation from St. Francis of Assisi, who was born thirty\r\nyears after the death of St. Bernard, disposes of this theory. In\r\nEngland there exist many manuscripts of the first three books, called\r\n“Musica Ecclesiastica,” frequently ascribed to the English mystic\r\nWalter Hilton. But Hilton seems to have died in 1395, and there is no\r\nevidence of the existence of the work before 1400. Many manuscripts\r\nscattered throughout Europe ascribe the book to Jean le Charlier de\r\nGerson, the great Chancellor of the University of Paris, who was a\r\nleading figure in the Church in the earlier part of the fifteenth\r\ncentury.

It has acted as a kind of dye to color the thinking of religious\r\npersons and has colored the eyes as well so that it is all but\r\nimpossible to detect its fallacy. In the face of every New Testament\r\nteaching to the contrary it has been said and sung throughout the\r\ncenturies and accepted as a part of the Christian message, the which it\r\nmost surely is not. Only the Quakers, so far as my knowledge goes, have\r\nhad the perception to see the error and the courage to expose it.\r\n\r\nHere are the facts as I see them. For four hundred years Israel had\r\ndwelt in Egypt, surrounded by the crassest idolatry. By the hand of\r\nMoses they were brought out at last and started toward the land of\r\npromise. The very idea of holiness had been lost to them. To correct\r\nthis, God began at the bottom.
